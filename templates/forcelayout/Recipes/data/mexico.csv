Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

Also known as the bariatric surgery, this treatment is one of the safest and most effective ways to achieve significant weight loss in an obese patient. People, who are obese and prone to heart diseases or suffering from type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cancer, depression, hypertension and other degenerative illnesses, undergo weight loss surgery for quick relief.

Weight loss surgery in Mexico has proved to be promising for people suffering from health conditions like diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and arthropathies due to morbid obesity. Apart from all the modern amenities and resources required for successful bariatric surgery, Mexico is a land of beaches, hills and metropolitan cities. It is one of the most beautiful Latin American countries and is known for its intangible cultural heritage.

  The World Health Organisation is urging all countries to consider a tax on surgary drinks.
This comes as the WHO observe a special day dedicated to reducing obesity rates across the world.
Kim Hyesung tells us more.   
The World Health Organisation has backed a ""sugar tax"" on soft drinks.
  The global health group had previously advised a lower sugar intake, but stopped short of backing tax measures.
But in a new 36-page report released Tuesday, the WHO said raising soft drink prices by 20 percent or more results in lower consumption and ""improved nutrition.""
  Around 41 million children under five were overweight or obese in 2014, marking an increase of about 10 million over the past two decades,   while global obesity rates more than doubled between 1980 and 2014... to over half a billion people.
The report said rising sugar consumption like sodas and fruit juices is a major factor in the soaring number of people suffering from obesity and related diseases like diabetes.
  In a statement, Dr. Douglas Bettcher, Director of the WHO’s Department for Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases,... said,...   ""If governments tax products like sugary drinks, they can reduce suffering and save lives. They can also cut healthcare costs and increase revenues to invest in health services."" 

  The WHO has advised people that they don't need any sugar in their diets nutritionally.... and recommended that people keep their sugar intake below 10 percent of their total daily calorie intake, and ideally limit it to 5 percent. 
  Already, several countries, including France and Mexico, have implemented a sugar tax.
According to the WHO, Mexico saw its soft drink sales drop six percent in 2014 after implementing a 10 percent price hike the same year. 

The WHO report also recommends using subsidies to reduce the prices of fruits and vegetables by 10 to 30 percent to encourage people to buy them and boost their nutrition levels.

Televisa, TV Azteca and Milenio TV all refused to air this commercial as paid advertising, in violation of the Mexican population's rights to information and health. What's more important: public health or the soda industry's interests?

In September 2012, the Nutritional Health Alliance—a civil society network—produced this commercial to endorse a soda tax and to raise awareness about the seriousness of overweight and obesity as a public health problem in Mexico, the country with some of the highest rates of soda consumption and childhood and adult obesity worldwide.

The ad states, ""More than 70 million Mexicans are overweight. If we raise the cost of soda and sugary drinks just a little, we will reduce obesity and the money will help us combat this epidemic and install drinking water fountains in schools and public spaces.""

According to a national public opinion poll, 70% of the Mexican population was in favor of a soda tax, if the money were to be allocated to fight obesity and to install drinking water fountains. 

The soda tax was passed and entered into effect in January 2014. In May 2014, the instalment of drinking fountains in all public and private schools in Mexico became mandatory by federal law.

With regional coronavirus death rates surpassed only by those in the United States and Brazil, eating habits of Mexicans are coming under scrutiny. 
The government recently revealed that among the 65,241 Mexicans who have died of the coronavirus during the worldwide pandemic, many suffered from high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.  
""In Mexico what we have seen with preliminary data is that the severity per COVID increases by 44% in people who suffer from obesity, 87% in people who suffer from diabetes, and 77% in people who suffer from hypertension"", said Simon Barquera, Director of Mexico's Nutrition and Health Research Center at the National Institute of Public Health.
The high rates of obesity are caused by a certain genetic predisposition to obesity, explained Carlos Alberto Aguilar, the Head of Nutrition at Mexico's National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition.
In addition, Aguilar said that Mexico's obesity is also caused by a sedentary life style and an excessive supply of traditional food and ultra-processed products.
""Our people have been affected worse by the high level of chronic diseases that we have had for several decades"", said Aguilar.
The government's alarm may aid in implementing two previously existing federal mandates to improve the nutrition and health of Mexicans on a national level.
At the local level, the Gulf coast state of Tabasco passed sales restrictions on the sale of sugary bottled drinks and high-carbohydrate snacks this week.
The southern state of Oaxaca became the first to do so in mid-August. 
Legislators in other states have introduced similar bills, all of which forbid merchants from selling ""junk"" food to minors unless their parent or guardian is present and approves. 
Barquera is convinced that with the right information, people will be able to make better decisions about what foods to eat.
The Nutrition and Health Research Center sponsors mandatory warning labels on high-calorie foods, in part because obesity and poor diet attributed directly to the the deaths of half of those under the age of 65 who died of the virus.
The United Nations Children's Fund considers child obesity a health emergency in Mexico, pointing to the fact that the country's children are the highest consumers of junk food with many getting 40% of their total caloric intake from it.

His government unveiled a ""Better Health"" campaign on Monday, saying it would tackle the ""obesity time bomb"" by banning advertising of junk food before 9.00 p.m., ending ""buy one get one free"" deals and putting calories on menus.

17. Uribe with a little boy, unwrapping his present - a frying pan
STORYLINE
Manuel Uribe, who once weighed half a ton but has now slimmed down to around 310 kilograms (700 pounds), celebrated his 43rd birthday on Wednesday with a simple wish for the coming year: to be able to stand on his own two feet to get married.
Interviewed at his home in northern Mexico, where he can still do little more than sit up in bed, Uribe said that over two years of steady dieting has helped him lose around 250 kilos (550 pounds) from his Guinness record weight of 560 kilos (1,235 lbs).
""A man that was about to die weighing almost 600 kilograms or more - because I weighed more than 600 kilograms, but only 560 (kilos) registered.
So, the Guinness World Record gave me the title of ""The Fattest man in the world,"" said Uribe.
But although he may have shed more pounds than any person in the history of weight loss, Uribe is still unable to walk his fiancee, Claudia Solis, down the aisle.
Yet, Uribe says he is content to live with what he has.
""Thanks to God I have learned to be happy with what I have at this moment.  What I have is my life, this body.""
When Uribe decided to attend an outdoor party in March - a rare outing to celebrate Claudia's 38th birthday - it was complicated by the fact he hasn't been able to get out of bed for the last six years.
So a flatbed tow truck was found to move his specially reinforced bed down a road to the outing, but it got caught in an underpass and he had to turn back.
The couple met four years ago and have been romantically involved for the last two years. 
""In the eyes of God, we are already married,"" Uribe says.
Proudly showing off her sparkling engagement ring, Solis, a 38-year-old hairdresser, acknowledged life with the world's fattest man was not always easy.
Her first husband, who was also obese, died of respiratory failure and she said her family were initially against the match with Uribe.
Uribe, a former autoparts dealer, said his birthday party will be low key.
Just over two years ago, a team of doctors offered to help him change his eating habits and tackle his extreme obesity.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time, and by many as the greatest ever. He was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award.[7][8] Maradona's vision, passing, ball control and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature (1.65 m or 5 ft 5 in), which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other football players; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he also possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free-kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname ""El Pibe de Oro"" (""The Golden Boy""), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.[9]

An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona was the first player in football history to set the world record transfer fee twice, first when he transferred to Barcelona for a then-world record £5  million, and second, when he transferred to Napoli for another record fee £6.9  million.[10] He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli and Barcelona where he won numerous accolades.

In his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the ""Hand of God"", while the second goal followed a 60 m (66 yd) dribble past five England players, voted ""Goal of the Century"" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.[11]

Maradona became the coach of Argentina's national football team in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011–12 season. In 2017, Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season.[12] In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest.[13] He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July.[14] From September 2018 to June 2019, Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados.[15] He was the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata from 2019 until his death.","RIP Diego Maradona 1960 2020 🥀~ Greatest Ever Highlights"

The mini-gastric bypass procedure has gained popularity in recent years. The mini-gastric bypass was originally developed by Dr. Robert Rutledge in 1997. The mini-gastric bypass is quicker, technically easier and carries a lower complication rate compared to traditional Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery.

The mini-gastric bypass procedure is restrictive and malabsorptive. This means that the procedure reduces the size of your stomach, restricting the amount you can eat. The procedure also reduces absorption of food by bypassing up to 6 feet of intestines. Gastric bypass and the mini-gastric bypass are both malabsorptive and restrictive procedures. Gastric sleeve and the Lap Band are restrictive procedures.","Mini Gastric Bypass (MGB) Surgery for Morbid Obesity"

Subscribe to Journeyman here: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...

In one small Mexican village, residents are praying for rain. The ceremony appears traditional, apart from one element: a dozen or so bottles of Coca Cola. ”It’s seen as a sacred drink now"", explains one resident. ”It allows you to purify your soul. That’s the power of Coca Cola.” Ironically, it is the presence of Coca Cola’s nearby factory that is partly to blame for the dearth in drinking water. The factory uses six litres of water for every litre of cola and draws it from the area’s dwindling groundwater supply. Now residents have to buy water from tankers. “I spend a quarter of my salary on getting water"", says resident Rodolfo. In fact, it can be cheaper to drink solely Coca Cola: Mexico has become the biggest consumer of the soft drink in the world, to the detriment of the population’s health. The extent to which a single corporation can affect a nation is nowhere more pertinent than here.

Another mass grave is being excavated at Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos, around 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) south of El Salto by road, where a further 25 bodies have been found.Read MoreSolís did not offer an explanation for the existence of the mass graves, but Jalisco state has seen rising violence in recent years.The mass grave is located at a farm.It's the base of Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico's ""most powerful and fastest growing"" drug cartels, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Jalisco has also exhumed the highest number of bodies from mass graves from 2006 to September 30, 2020 of any of Mexico's states, according to a report from the National Search Commission published in October.There were 897 bodies exhumed in the state over that period, of a total 6,900 in the country.Last month, a grim discovery was made in neighboring Guanajuato state, where the remains of 59 bodies were dug up, Reuters reported.The clandestine graves were found in the Salvatierra municipality, which has seen surging homicide rates as rival drug trafficking organizations battle for control of the area, Reuters said.And in March 2017 a mass grave containing more than 250 human skulls was uncovered in Veracruz state, central Mexico.The mass grave found in Veracruz state could be the largest in Mexico, state attorney general Jorge Winckler told CNN affiliate Televisa at the time.","Mexican authorities uncover 113 bodies in mass grave"

But there have been some downsides too. Especially in the way Mexicans consume and eat.

Correspondent Lara Rodriguez takes a closer look at the post-NAFTA eating habits and food-related illnesses in Mexico.

This week I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Rocio Salas-Whalen, Triple Board Certified Physician in Endocrinology, Obesity, and Diabetes! Dr. Salas-Whalen is originally from Mexico, where she completed her medical education. She came to the United States as an international medical student and completed the board examinations necessary to enter the match! She faced a lot of challenges as an immigrant physician, including having to work as a medical assistant to pay for her expenses WHILE studying for the STEP exam. She shares her experience as a resident, fellow, and now as an independent practicing physician and business owner! Dr. Salas-Whalen imparts the importance of patient-centered care and how starting her practice has given her the freedom she always desired. She shares the benefits of having more time with patients and more flexibility for her family and kids. Her journey was FAR from easy, but she remained focused on her one goals and now she is a BOSS in New York combating the obesity epidemic every day! She is a testament to how phenomenal women in medicine can be and an inspiring Latina in medicine! I hope you learn something new from this episode!!

Sleeve gastrectomy is a type of bariatric surgery that drastically reduces the size of the stomach. Also known as a vertical gastrectomy, a partial gastrectomy, gastric reduction, as well as a greater curvature gastrectomy, this type of procedure is offered as an alternative to gastric bypass surgeries and encourages weight-loss in obese patients by removing up to 85% of the stomach. This is a permanent procedure that cannot be reversed, but one that is providing a growing number of obese patients from around the world with life-saving benefits.

Sleeve gastrectomy procedures are effective and safe for patients with high-risk and high BMI (body mass index) ranges. In many cases, this surgical procedure allows patients to lose 100 pounds or more, which helps to improve health and reduce medical issues that result from obesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, as well as the lack of mobility and quality of life.

Obesity affects hundreds of millions of people in  rich and developing nations.  

But the wide availability of cheap fast food in the US has made the battle against it challenging.

Six months ago King Abdullah asked for Khalid Mohsin Shaer to be taken to hospital but had to wait until a special bed was made for him in the US.

The 20-year-old patient was taken to King Fahd Medical City in Riyadh on Monday after the Saudi King arranged for his special air transportation from the southern city of Jazan.

A forklift was used to transfer him to an ambulance which took him to a local airport in Jazan. Report by Andrea Lilly.

As the virus proliferates around the globe and more is learnt about its affects on the body they are realizing this co-morbidity could mean the difference between life and death. With higher instances of diabetes, hypertension & cardiovascular diseases among the general population due to obesity, certain countries like South Africa is at particular risk for as long as there is no cure for Covid-19.

Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

The 'Health Stations' are fitted with a motion sensor which counts out ten squats with people using the machines. 
During the exercise, health tips are displayed on a screen, encouraging people to change their eating habits and consider doing more exercise. 
At the end of the work out, users receive a pedometer so they can monitor their daily physical activity.
The 'Health Stations' have been placed in 15 bus stations since the first week of January. 
The plan aims to place them in all bus and underground stations in the near future.

This has led to changes in diet that are detrimental to health with an increase in sedentary behavior and increased access to low-priced highly energy-dense foods. As a result, rapid growth in the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related non-communicable diseases has been observed (i.e. diabetes). According to a report from the OECD, more than one in three adults in Mexico are obese. Similarly, according to UNICEF, Mexico has highest world rate in childhood obesity.

""Choosing Better to Eat Healthier"" is a social network supported intervention for guiding and promoting healthier nutrition habits among the participants. It was made possible by a grant from the World Bank’s Youth for Innovation Fund. The project was led by World Bank staff Karina Ramirez and Till Hartmann. Implementation was supported by local health coach Samantha Mendoza and nutritionist Alejandra Romo.","Choosing Better to Eat Healthier"

What's the deal with all the enablers? And can't the people on the show just make better choices? The answers to these questions might surprise you, so let's weigh in on the false things you can stop believing about My 600-lb Life.

Dr. Now, as his patients call him, has become quite the reality TV star thanks to the popularity of his show. But some viewers might think that he basically just plays a doctor on TV, and isn't really that great at what he does. 

But Dr. Now is actually a pioneer in his field, with a long and successful career in medicine. For one, most doctors and hospitals won't accept patients over 450 pounds for weight loss surgery because they don't have the right equipment, but Dr. Now accepts many patients who far exceed that weight. Additionally, he was the first doctor in all of Houston to use laparoscopic techniques for groundbreaking procedures, and has published his work in prestigious medical journals. So don't go thinking he just portrays a doctor on TV, this M.D. is the real deal.

Mexico: Mexico outweighs US on obesity scale

Mexico, according to officials at the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation, has overtaken the US when it comes to adult obesity levels. Mexico has a 32.8 percent adult obesity rate, while the US has a rate 31.8 percent. The report stated that weight-related diabetes is on the rise, with almost one in six Mexican adults falling victim to the illness. Some 100,000 Mexicans are dying per year due to contracting diabetes.

The rise in obesity and related deaths has been ascribed to the increased consumption of fast food and sugary sodas. Mexican food is widely known to be calorific, with delicacies like burritos, nachos, tacos and quesadillas packing on the pounds. Dr. Abelardo Avila Curiel from the National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition traces the trend to the low cost of such produce, saying: ""For the first time in our history, we see individuals becoming obese and malnourished within just a few years. This is an extremely serious matter.""

Curiel stressed the importance of the food industry as a factor in the crisis, saying: ""Our food consumption habit is being ruled by the sector of the food industry that produces the so called junk food. This means food that has no positive nutritional value and which consumption, at the volumes we are ingesting them, is extremely harmful to our health. That means the obesity epidemic in our society cannot be explained without taking in consideration the exaggerated consumption of these products.""","Mexico: Mexico outweighs US on obesity scale"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJBlPFv_Uac","(2 Sep 2020) Mexican health officials are increasingly worried about the correlation between the country's high rates of obesity and the number of COVID-19-related deaths.
With regional coronavirus death rates surpassed only by those in the United States and Brazil, eating habits of Mexicans are coming under scrutiny. 
The government recently revealed that among the 65,241 Mexicans who have died of the coronavirus during the worldwide pandemic, many suffered from high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.  
""In Mexico what we have seen with preliminary data is that the severity per COVID increases by 44% in people who suffer from obesity, 87% in people who suffer from diabetes, and 77% in people who suffer from hypertension"", said Simon Barquera, Director of Mexico's Nutrition and Health Research Center at the National Institute of Public Health.
The high rates of obesity are caused by a certain genetic predisposition to obesity, explained Carlos Alberto Aguilar, the Head of Nutrition at Mexico's National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition.
In addition, Aguilar said that Mexico's obesity is also caused by a sedentary life style and an excessive supply of traditional food and ultra-processed products.
""Our people have been affected worse by the high level of chronic diseases that we have had for several decades"", said Aguilar.
The government's alarm may aid in implementing two previously existing federal mandates to improve the nutrition and health of Mexicans on a national level.
At the local level, the Gulf coast state of Tabasco passed sales restrictions on the sale of sugary bottled drinks and high-carbohydrate snacks this week.
The southern state of Oaxaca became the first to do so in mid-August. 
Legislators in other states have introduced similar bills, all of which forbid merchants from selling ""junk"" food to minors unless their parent or guardian is present and approves. 
Barquera is convinced that with the right information, people will be able to make better decisions about what foods to eat.
The Nutrition and Health Research Center sponsors mandatory warning labels on high-calorie foods, in part because obesity and poor diet attributed directly to the the deaths of half of those under the age of 65 who died of the virus.
The United Nations Children's Fund considers child obesity a health emergency in Mexico, pointing to the fact that the country's children are the highest consumers of junk food with many getting 40% of their total caloric intake from it.

The obesity epidemic has spread to the Third World and it is likely 1 billion people will be obese by 2030. So how did it explode in places that, not so long ago, counted malnutrition and even famine as major concerns? Well it's mostly about the aggressive marketing and low prices of Western fast food. As globalisation and a little more money open up Third World markets, the first to step in are the likes of McDonalds and Coke. In this global production, we travel to China where the consumption of sugar and oil has sent the national scales spinning; to Brazil where global food companies have fundamentally altered traditional diets; to India where it's predicted 100 million people will soon be suffering diabetes and on to Mexico, where the weight problem is so pressing, stomach reduction surgery is offered for free. The diagnosis is stark: ""No country has managed the transition to get rid of hunger without it shifting to obesity"" says anti-obesity crusader Barry Popkin. In a world where we are bombarded with messages to eat more hundreds of times a day, it's clear that obesity is a ticking time bomb.","Globesity: Fat's New Frontier"

The lockdown decreed to try and control the pandemic rendered innumerable city and town workers unemployed, unpaid, unable to rent or eat, and transportless. With no other choice, they started walking thousands of kilometres, parched and hungry under the burning summer sun, to go back to their villages, many accompanied by frail and starving family members. Some never made it, others eventually stumbled to their village border, often to be met with hostility – possible carriers of a deadly infection; unexpected extra mouths to feed. These were all people who were the fuel that ran the towns and cities: factory workers, construction labour, electricians, plumbers, delivery boys, shop assistants, newspaper vendors, sellers of fruit and vegetables, laundrymen, eatery cooks and waiters, tea boys, taxi drivers, domestic staff: all of whom arrived from who knew where each morning and removed themselves to who knew where each night. All of whom suddenly became “migrants”. What do you do when your land becomes “the mouth of a shark”. What policies, failures and inefficiencies let down those who support the weight of our cities, when they most needed support. Is the existence of an urban worker inevitably precarious. Is it possible to work towards ensuring a safety net. Surely these are questions that merit urgent attention – and answers.

Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

    Dr. David Wallinga, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy
    Moderated by Karen Hansen-Kuhn, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy


Description:  Global diets are increasingly facing the dual challenge of undernourishment and obesity. UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier de Schutter, has released a new report calling for a reassessment of unhealthy food systems in both rich and poor countries. Both are increasingly characterized by an abundance of low nutrition, high calorie, processed foods. A recent study by Sarah Clark, Corinna Hawkes, Sophia Murphy, Karen Hansen-Kuhn and David Wallinga in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health  examines the role U.S. agriculture and trade policies play in contributing to the rise in obesity, with a spotlight on Mexico. See IATP's summary fact sheet on the article at iatp.org, or read the full article. Join us for this discussion about how our global food system is driving the rapid rise in diet-related disease, and what can be done about it.","Exporting Obesity?

""We are filled with joy to be able to receive our faithful and to be with them at this time when it has been so hard for them not to participate in the celebrations,"" said Salvador Gonzalez Morales, Auxiliary Bishop.

Mexico is raising its estimate for the death toll for about two-thirds of the country by 55% between mid-March and late June following the coronavirus outbreak, according to health officials.

The Latin American nation said in 20 out of 32 states alone, fatalities from Covid-19 and other causes increased by 71,315 to a total of 202,077 from March 15 to June 27. That compares with the 130,763 earlier expected, according to a report by the health ministry on Saturday.

A total of 43,680 have died in Mexico from coronavirus, the fourth-highest number of fatalities globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The total number of cases has risen to 390,516.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Saturday the pandemic has affected Mexico more than many other countries, according to Milenio website, as the virus hit people with underlying conditions. “Many Mexicans have lost their lives because of chronic diseases; we have a a country with ill people due to chronic ailments such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity,” he said.

Mexico’s economic activity plunged by a record 22.7% in May from a year earlier, deepening a crisis caused by the outbreak. The nation’s oil industry has also taken a toll from the pandemic with 240 Covid-19 related deaths.

He notes in several studies, this is independent of other co-morbidities and COVID-19 appears to be one disease that does not benefit from the obesity paradox that exists in other cardiovascular diseases. He also notes that it is too late to address this with patients now, but that clinicians can influence future outcomes of outbreaks of such diseases by encouraging their patients to increase their cardiorespiratory fitness through regular exercise.","Obesity and Outcomes in COVID-19"

Obesity is the scourge of overfed high income countries, right? THINK AGAIN! We weigh up the escalating global epidemic of obesity. In countries where hunger was once the killer, hundreds of millions of people could now be eating themselves to death.

In this global production, we travel to China where the consumption of sugar and oil has sent the national scales spinning; to Brazil where global food companies have fundamentally altered traditional diets; to India where it's predicted 100 million people will soon be suffering diabetes and on to Mexico, where the weight problem is so pressing, stomach reduction surgery is offered for free. The diagnosis is stark: ""No country has managed the transition to get rid of hunger without it shifting to obesity"" says anti-obesity crusader Barry Popkin. 

On the outskirts of Mexico City, the Bravo family is celebrating a birthday. Eating is a way of life here and the bigger the occasion, the bigger the portions. Juan Luis' father died from obesity at 42, and it made him take stock of his own size 56 trousers. Juan Luis has already undergone surgery to reduce the size of his stomach but three years on, unable to control his eating habits, he's packing nappies to go back to hospital. ""The thing I fear most is to die on the operating table, or to fail again"".

Mexicans are getting fatter faster than any other nation, largely due to their addiction to soft drinks. They drink a queasy ½ litre per person per day. Women in colourful cloaks hand out free Cokes to children at a mother's day parade in Chiapas. ""Babies have Coca Cola in their bottles instead of a formula"" explains Dr Abelardo Avila. ""Most of the adult population were malnourished as children and is programmed for food scarcity. When the body enters into a time of food abundance, especially sugar and saturated fat, the damage to the metabolism is brutal"". Diabetes is now the primary cause of death in Mexico.

""The Biggest Loser"" is a live-in weight loss camp in Shenzhen, China. Teenager Pan Jingyi is here because ""people laugh"" when she buys clothes. More than 380 million people in China are overweight or obese. The average Chinese consumes 400 calories of vegetable oil a day. There's also so much sugar consumed in China today, explains Barry Popkin, ""they have a sugar reserve along with the pork reserve. The government is so worried that sugar prices will go up, it will cause political unrest.""

Food companies, it seems, are operating in a moral vacuum: ""There are certain types of foods, 'food products' that are as bad as tobacco and alcohol"" says Brazil's Professor Carlos Monteiro. Here companies like Nestle market their calorific products aggressively, sending out door to door vendors like Vanderlea Rodrigues. ""I know that chocolate is a good source of energy"" she gushes. Nestle even has a boat that ferries snacks into the villages of Amazonia. 

But it's in India that we make the most shocking discovery: junk food products are altering not just the waistlines of young and old but even the genetic make-up of future generations. Dr Ranjan Yajnik runs a Diabetes Unit in Pune. He has found that babies are being programmed for diabetes and heart disease even while they're still in the womb, due to the mother's diet. ""That tells the genes how to behave, and that remains with the baby for the rest of life."" 

In a world where we are bombarded with messages to eat more hundreds of times a day, it's clear that obesity is a ticking time bomb.

Although some of the health benefits of guava leaves have not been scientifically proven, guava leaves have been successfully used as a traditional cure for diarrhea especially, by top producers of guava; India, and China.

Guava trees are known to originate in Central America and some parts of Mexico. Its fruits are highly acclaimed as a superfruit because of its extraordinarily rich benefits. Guava fruits can be taken in different forms such as syrup, jam, beverages, and as medicine.  Although guava fruits have tremendous health benefits, guava leaves are even more beneficial.

Depression might be even more a danger to our wellbeing than weight, as indicated by a 2017 article distributed by the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C. At the present time there are such huge numbers of individuals feeling forlorn that numerous countries like the United States now confront what is being known as a ""dejection plague."" (1) truth be told, forlornness is a main antecedent to despondency and liquor addiction, and in addition a wide range of other restorative concerns. 

For what reason would this be? First off, forlornness has been found to build the levels of both anxiety hormones and circulatory strain, which has a significantly negative effect on one of your most crucial organs: the heart. No big surprise a forlornness equivalent word is ""anguish."" (2). 

Feeling alone every now and then isn't unusual or fundamentally reason to get excited, yet when sentiments of detachment and depression endure it can truly take a genuine toll on all parts of your wellbeing — and regularly, you won't to see the negative wellbeing sway until some other time. Is it safe to say that it isn't such incongruity that there is presently a depression pestilence occurring in this advanced age when we are apparently more associated than any other time in recent memory? Connecting with somebody through the PC or by other virtual means is simply not the same as observing each other face to face or hearing a voice on the opposite end of the telephone. Not exclusively are a large number of us now feeling all the more alone with this innovation, but at the same time we're losing our relational aptitudes. 

Individuals of any age can feel forlorn, however this feeling can be a particularly dangerous among the elderly. A 2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences found that forlornness and social disconnection in more established men and ladies is connected to expanded mortality. (3) Regardless of your age, you will probably encounter snapshots of dejection in your life, yet the considerable news is that characteristic solutions for depression are for the most part propensities and decisions in your control and you can take feel better soon. 

What Is Loneliness Exactly?. 

Norman Cousins, writer the top of the line book ""Life systems of an Illness,"" once stated, ""The everlasting mission of the individual person is to smash his forlornness."" This is only one of numerous depression cites that addresses many individuals' hearts. There are likewise loads of forlornness sonnets and dejection tunes out there, which isn't amazing since depression is such a typical yet upsetting feeling for individuals of any age. 

What is the real depression definition? Forlornness is the condition of feeling desolate. The Merriam-Webster word reference characterizes forlorn in various ways, including: being without organization, cut off from others, tragic from being distant from everyone else, or delivering a sentiment grimness or destruction. (4). 

It's extremely essential to take note of that being physically alone doesn't simply naturally compare to depression. As Psychology Today calls attention to: (5). 

Depression is a negative state, set apart by a feeling of detachment. One feels that something is absent. It is conceivable to be with individuals and still feel forlorn—maybe the most intense type of depression. 

Isolation is the condition of being separated from everyone else without being desolate. It is a positive and useful condition of engagement with oneself. Isolation is attractive, a condition of being separated from everyone else where you give yourself magnificent and adequate organization.

In Latin America, social movements made up of farmers, agricultural workers, consumers, environmental groups, indigenous communities, and other experts have been pushing for greater food self-sufficiency, agro-ecological production and equitable nutrition policies. This conference will address the opportunities and obstacles to transforming the current food system in Latin America and what the rest of the world can learn from it.

An international group of scientists studying diabetes says the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how much more vulnerable people with the disease are.
Their report released to coincide with World Diabetes Day (14 November 2020) says people with diabetes are two times more likely to experience severe symptoms, or death from SARS- CoV-2.

STORY-LINE:
Diets around the world may vary, but in a growing number of countries obesity, poor nutrition and a change in lifestyle are leading to soaring numbers of people with diabetes.
The overwhelming majority, according to a new study are Type 2, which results from the body's ineffective use of insulin. 
The World Health Organization says this type of diabetes is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.
The study in the Lancet medical journal says countries with the greatest burden are China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, and Thailand.
They account for 217 million cases of type 2 diabetes, that's half of the world's diabetes cases. 
The aim of the study in the Lancet medical is to suggest a blueprint for the care of people with diabetes.
It calls for proactive measures to seek out people with the disease and screen them on a regular basis. 
It also recommends education and dietary information.
According to the study 463 million people have diabetes, eighty percent of them are from low and middle income countries.
It says last year 4.2 million people died as a result of the condition and complications that arise from it.
These can be anything from blindness, kidney failure, stroke and heart attacks, it can also necessitate limb amputation.
Now scientists say there is a clear link between the disease and COVID-19.
Lead author of the study Professor Juliana Chan is the Director of the Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
She says the increased risks of COVID-19 for diabetics are clear.
""If we use the UK as an example because they've got national data, five percent of people have diabetes, but among those who die with COVID, one third have diabetes and the death rate, the complications rates are closely related to the control of the conditions,"" according to Chan.
Chan's co-author is Professor Rury Holman from the University of Oxford.
He says:  ""The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes is bidirectional early reports from China, particularly from Wuhan, informed us that people with diabetes got the disease more often and the outcomes were worse and that's been replicated across the world in other such studies. We've also seen that people are precipitating diabetes, type one diabetes has become more common because the disease precipitates it and people with diabetes get worse metabolic control. One of the key findings has been that amongst the other risk factors for COVID hypoglycaemia, that's high blood glucose levels also make the outcomes worse and conversely, hopefully, if we were to improve glucose levels, we could reduce the risk for people with COVID-19 and diabetes.""
Holman says research into how COVID-19 works is revealing how diabetes patients may be at greater risk.
Chan and Holman are among the 44 diabetes specialists who've created a blueprint for diabetes care.
According to the study as nations move out of poverty, people's eating habits and lifestyle may change thereby increasing their risk of diabetes.
Chan says the current situation is not sustainable.

Sleeve gastrectomy is a type of bariatric surgery that drastically reduces the size of the stomach. Also known as a vertical gastrectomy, a partial gastrectomy, gastric reduction, as well as a greater curvature gastrectomy, this type of procedure is offered as an alternative to gastric bypass surgeries and encourages weight-loss in obese patients by removing up to 85% of the stomach. This is a permanent procedure that cannot be reversed, but one that is providing a growing number of obese patients from around the world with life-saving benefits.

Sleeve gastrectomy procedures are effective and safe for patients with high-risk and high BMI (body mass index) ranges. In many cases, this surgical procedure allows patients to lose 100 pounds or more, which helps to improve health and reduce medical issues that result from obesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, as well as the lack of mobility and quality of life.

Mexican tattoo artist Omi Debua has been giving COVID-19 survivors a free tattoo. He exhibited his skills on Saturday, by tattooing a coronavirus survivor in his studio in Monterrey.

""It feels great to be able to give a tattoo to a person who survived a disease that is very strong here in Mexico,"" he said. ""Have a lot of patience and follow the recommendations given by your doctor. And if you recover and want a tattoo, contact me.""

Debua could be seen preparing the stencil for the tattoo, reading ""COVID-19 SURVIVOR,""  before placing said stencil on Reyna's arm, and tattooing him.

Reyna on the other hand spoke about his experience with the virus, revealing that his father was hospitalised and that he was afraid to lose him. ""He was admitted and was very bad, I worried too much about him, I did come to think that I was going to lose him, but thank God, I did not.""

""Maybe it didn't hit me that hard, but I just understood it when I saw my father on the hospital gurney, who was convalescing, it did hit me very hard,"" he added.

Mexico has reported over 595,800 cases of coronavirus since the start of the outbreak, according to statistics gathered by Johns Hopkins University. Over 64,000 have died with the virus.

Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

A large portion of the population of the United States suffers from diabetes. Many more are at risk. Diabetes leads to very serious complications and often to slow, painful death. This is frequently the case in San Antonio, where 18% of adults are diabetic. For too many people, traditional medical approaches have not and are not working. Seriously addressing this problem means working on at least three different levels: 1) fully deploy the new diagnostic technology of hemoglobin A1C, 2) take a community organizing approach to diabetes prevention, and 3) address head-on the excess sugar in the American diet.

Dr. Thomas Schlenker, M.D. is director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District and health authority for Bexar County, responsible for its 1.7 million inhabitants. He grew up in Wisconsin, studied political science at Antioch College, medicine at Northwestern, and public health at Harvard. Dr. Schlenker, a board certified pediatrician trained at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, had taken care of sick children and run health departments in Milwaukee, Madison, Salt Lake City, Nicaragua, and Chiapas, Mexico before coming to San Antonio in 2011. He has been a Fulbright Senior Fellow at the National Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca, Mexico and has served as adjunct faculty at the Medical College of Wisconsin and the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. The current foci of his work are teen pregnancy, syphilis, health care financing, and obesity and diabetes, all major concerns of the San Antonio community.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","Getting serious about diabesity | Thomas Schlenker | TEDxSanAntonio"

Which means, the food we eat has a strong influence on how we connect to each other. But one of the issues lies in the fact that the environment we have created around us is conducive and supportive to sickness, and is ultimately preventing us from experiencing deeper connections. 

 In this episode of the Align Podcast, I have a conversation with Shawn Stevenson on what contributes to deeper human connection, how the media affects our relationships, and why Shawn’s marriage has been successful.

 Plus, he also discusses how nutrition plays a surprising role in sleep, his thoughts on the conventional medicine approach.

 Shawn is a bestselling author of Sleep Smarter and has another book coming out, Eat Smarter, is a nutritionist, science educator, &amp; creator of The Model Health Show, featured as the #1 Health Podcast in the U.S.

Acceptance of unhealthy behaviors such as over eating or over restricting should be seen and treated with compassion and care while also not dismissing them.

You also find out how many healthy years of life are lost through being overweight.

People often suffered from too little to eat; today's ills come from consuming too much

Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2Vj

The world is getting wider and that's a big problem. Since 1980 obesity rates among adults have nearly doubled worldwide, with even faster growth in emerging markets such as Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico. 

In 2008 one in three adults globally was too fat. a common measure for obesity is a person's body mass index, or BMI, which compares the ratio of weight to height. A 175cm, or 5 foot 9, man weighing more than 77 kilograms or 170 pounds would have a BMI greater than 25, and thus considered overweight. 

By this measure two-thirds of American adults are overweight and an alarming 36% of adults are not just overweight but obese with a BMI above 30. If current trends continue nearly half of American adults may be obese by 2030. 

This is bad for health but not all fat is created equal. Most harmful is a plump midsection with visceral fat packed around the organs. This can bring diabetes, heart disease, and other ailments. As people become fatter they are growing sicker. Incidents of diabetes has grown virtually everywhere. Excess fat is blamed for a surge in chronic diseases. 44% of the burden of diabetes, 23% of ischemic heart disease, and as much as 41% of different types of cancer.

This is straining healthcare systems. More people are living with ailments brought by obesity, especially in the Middle East and Oceania. And unlike smoking, which kills, obese people are sicker for longer. 

Some blame the weighty problem on sugary drinks and fast-food restaurants, which have invaded emerging markets. Soft drink sales more than doubled worldwide over the past decade but more than quadrupled in India, Brazil, and China. 

Among possible solutions governments may try to cut the portion size of junk food or make school lunches healthier. Some may complain of the nanny state. It marks an incredible turning point - for most of history man has worried about eating too little, today, many ailments come from consuming too much.

The obesity strategy here will include restrictions on television advertising and a crackdown on supermarket deals promoting chocolate and crisps.

In Japan - where only 3.5% of the population is obese compared to 28.7% in the UK - the focus is on a healthier diet with prominence given to rice, vegetables and fish, as well as smaller portions.

The Finnish city of Seinäjoki managed to curb childhood obesity with a ‘health in all policies’ approach to decision-making and by working with day care centres to eliminate sugary snacks for small children.

Dubai took more drastic measures in 2013, rewarding weight loss with gold.

Thousands of people have been killed there since 2008 when Mexican President Felipe Calderon sent in the army to carry out his offensive against the drug cartels.

The official story is that the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels are fighting for the city and the access it provides to the multi-billion dollar U.S. drug market only a few hundred metres away.

Fault Lines travels to Ciudad Juarez and asks how human life there came to be worth so much less than the drugs being trafficked through it.

In fact, witchcraft here is not only alive; it’s thriving, and it’s even feared by politicians. There are hundreds of witches in the country, and they make and break marriages, cure diseases, cast or release people from good and evil spells, and predict the future. Supposedly, one in ten Romanians visits a witch.

Juan Pedro Franco Salas began his diet just over four and a half months ago in an attempt to reduce his original weight of 595 kilos (1,311 pounds).
He managed his weight loss despite only being able to exercise using his arms, as he is still too heavy to stand for long periods.
The 32-year-old hopes to shed enough weight to be fit for the first installment of his gastric bypass on 9 May, which will be followed by a second surgery six months later.

Wherever one walks, a cup of soda drink in hand – the regular scene on street.

(Soundbite) Karina Fernandez Mejia, Technical Secretary, 
Health Commission of Chamber of Deputies
""Chamber deputies of the Health Committee are aware of the serious problems involved with excessive consumption of sugary drinks. It has a terrible impact reflected in chronic degenerative diseases of much population in our country.”

The Mexican Chamber where Mejia works is now mulling a proposal to double the tax on sugary soda from one peso to two, or 10 U.S. cents.
The tax hike is expected to reduce consumption by 12 to 18 percent, and help contain the obesity rates, now 72% among adults, 35 % among adolescents and 34.4% among children.

(Soundbite) Karina Fernandez Mejia, Technical Secretary, 
Health Commission of Chamber of Deputies
""(We hope) the rise in tax will help magically eliminate the problems of obesity and cardio vascular diseases. Furthermore, you must combine a number of solutions in order to influence the population, such as nutrition education and more exercise.”

Sugary drink tax was first introduced in 2014. The consumption fell by 6% the next year, and then 8% the third year, according to non-official statistics.

(Soundbite) Karina Fernandez Mejia, Technical Secretary, 
Health Commission of Chamber of Deputies
“This problem can’t be attributed to a single factor, and its solution must also be multi-factorial.
Much of the population, including the youth and child, is very sedentary. So, we must also influence public policies that encourage exercise, sports and education both at home and in schools to reduce consumption (and help contain obesity).""

An average Mexican consumes half a liter of sugary soda or more each day.
Such an amount is alarmingly high, almost three times the world average.
Over drinking of sugary soda has been clinically proven to increase the risk of overweight, diabetes and cardio vascular risks.","Soda drink tax hike helps contain obesity of Mexicans, if combined with education and exercise"

In this podcast, we talk with Dr. Turner Osler who, after a successful career as a trauma surgeon, became a researcher and entrepreneur. You’ll find his story fascinating as you learn about the company he started and the legacy he is building to “change the way the world sits.” If you’ve ever heard that “sitting is the new smoking,” you’ll want to hear Dr. Osler explain how today’s comfortable desk chairs – with their lumbar support – can result in back pain and metabolic syndrome, a combination of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

So if you want to know:

Why our history as hunter-gatherers causes us back pain today
What back pain costs businesses each year – and what can be done about it
How a chair that changes people’s relationship to sitting can reduce the two epidemics threatening so many of us: back pain and metabolic syndrome
About a company that’s making a difference in people’s lives and making money
About Dr. Turner Osler
As a trauma surgeon, Dr. Turner Osler was always on the move – from the operating room to the ICU, to the ER and back to the operating room. When he became interested in the epidemiology of trauma and found himself sitting at a computer, doing mathematical modeling and writing code, he developed back pain. His own search for the reason and a cure led him to discover the relationship between sitting – which most office workers do all day long – and back pain, as well as the rise in high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels, high cholesterol and triglycerides, and obesity. Dr. Osler realized that the solution to back problems and “sitting disease” was a new kind of chair that forced its users to develop perfect posture and to get exercise while they were sitting.

Today QOR360 – pronounced “core three-sixty” – manufactures chairs in Vermont that are ergonomic, healthy and promote “active seating.” Through ButtOn Chairs, Dr. Osler offers schools the opportunity to make their own active seating chairs at a cost of just $5 each for the material. By allowing students to move at their desks, the chairs help children burn more calories and can even result in improved test scores. Learn more about Dr. Osler’s goal to give our children a future without back pain at buttonchairs.org.

Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

Seven out of 10 Mexicans are overweight or obese, despite nationwide government campaigns to get the population moving. The consequences of these conditions pose a severe burden on individuals, who might find themselves more susceptible to illnesses like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This in turn puts considerable pressure on the healthcare system; if unchecked, these medical conditions will increase the costs of healthcare to untenable levels. Prevention is the agreed strategy to tackle both institutional and individual healthcare problems.","Mexico Health Summit 2018 - OBESITY AND DIABETES: EDUCATION THE KEY TO PREVENTION?"

New taxes were recently passed in Mexico in response to the country named as the world's most obese nation. These taxes, which affect sodas and junk food, aim to curb the obesity rate. Soft drink manufactures are concerned with the tax as Mexico is Latin America's largest market for soda, with diet soda having no strong foothold in the country. Jonas Feliciano, Beverages Industry Analyst at Euromonitor states that although US consumers may be concerned with a potential loss of Mexican-manufactured Coke, soft drink manufacturers have larger concerns with initial Euromonitor forecasts showing a 3 percent decline of soda sales in the country.","The Implications of the Mexican Soft Drink Tax"

Bariatric Surgery Testimonials: http://www.placidway.com/testimonial-...

Medical Tourism is an excellent option for those who want fast access to affordable and high quality bariatric surgery. Traveling to another country for medical care has proved to be more advantageous than having surgery in the home country. There are plenty of countries which have invested in the development of healthcare infrastructure, that many times it is hard to make a difference in quality between highly industrialized countries such as the US or Canada, and emerging markets such as India, Thailand, Turkey, Mexico or South Korea.

Obesity Surgery Pricing/ Price: http://www.placidway.com/cost-treatme...

Overweight and obesity are the number one factors for cardiovascular diseases (stroke, high blood pressure and heart disease), musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis), chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes) and several types of cancer (breast, colon, endometrial and gallbladder), breathing problems (sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome), reproductive problems, gallstones, among other conditions.

The obesity epidemic keeps on to expand rapidly all over the world. Since 1980 worldwide obesity has almost doubled, impacting on people of all ages and lately, children under 5 years old. The statistics are alarming, and something has to be done until it is too late.

Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

Mexico has nowadays the first place in the ranking of countries with highest obesity and overweight rate. A 32,8% of Mexicans suffer from obesity, and within the adult population, 7 out of 10 people suffer from overweight. Reasons that have led to this situation are the actual lifestyle, more and more sedentary, and the diet, based in Mexican ""antojitos"" with in the origin were only typical in festivities, and the imported fizzy drinks, as well as the fast food. 

This issue has evident consequences in the population health, where the diseases related to overweight are the cause of de 26% of deaths, being the most common one the diabetes, with has already 10 million of victims and is suffered by 6,4 million people in Mexico. These health problems have also a negative economic answer, since the productive sector decreases and funds for diseases has to be increased. Solutions for this problem will be the reduction of fizzy drinks and fast food publicity and the throwback to the traditional healthy Mexican food, otherwise is expected that in 2030 the obesity and overweight increase a 300%.

At Obesity Control Center, the gastric bypass is considered the gold standard due to the significant weight loss results it may provide and its ability to reverse Type 2 Diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Gastric bypass is an invasive surgery, but is one of the most effective weight loss procedures available. The surgeons and physicians at OCC are among the leading authorities on the gastric bypass procedure, having performed this surgery over a significant number of years.

With over 50 years of combined experience and 23,000 successful bariatric surgeries performed, Obesity Control Center, located in Tijuana, Mexico, is considered a world leader in weight loss surgery.

http://www.placidway.com/medical-pack...

Sleeve gastrectomy is a type of bariatric surgery that drastically reduces the size of the stomach. Also known as a vertical gastrectomy, a partial gastrectomy, gastric reduction, as well as a greater curvature gastrectomy, this type of procedure is offered as an alternative to gastric bypass surgeries and encourages weight-loss in obese patients by removing up to 85% of the stomach. This is a permanent procedure that cannot be reversed, but one that is providing a growing number of obese patients from around the world with life-saving benefits.

Sleeve gastrectomy procedures are effective and safe for patients with high-risk and high BMI (body mass index) ranges. In many cases, this surgical procedure allows patients to lose 100 pounds or more, which helps to improve health and reduce medical issues that result from obesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, as well as the lack of mobility and quality of life.

Friends and family have paid their final respects to the world's heaviest man, Manuel Uribe, who died in Mexico on Monday after spending twenty days in hospital. The 48-year-old once tipped the scales at 560 kilos after a diet of pizzas and burgers in the United States, earning him a Guinness World Records title. He was reportedly taken to hospital by crane due to an abnormal heartbeat. Unable to find a suitable coffin for his large size, he had to be transported to the funeral home in Monterrey on the back of a truck. Report by Jeremy Barnes.

There are a number of studies that have come out about COVID 19 prognosis. We now have a powerful way to predict which patients with COVID 19 pneumonia are more likely to die, and more likely to require longer stays in the hospital. 

We already know that less than 15% of people who get COVID 19 have severe disease to the point of requiring hospitalization. Less than 5% of people who get coronavirus require ICU. For those with COVID 19 pneumonia who require ICU, and for some of the other patients in the hospital who might not necessarily need ICU, these are the patients who have the cytokine storm that we keep hearing about, meaning the immune system is going haywire, and there is a ton of inflammation taking place in the body….especially the lungs. But now, we have a more specific way of predicting who is more likely to develop cytokine storm, and therefore more likely to die, and who is more likely to require a longer stay in the hospital….and it's based on the bloodwork we get when patients are hospitalized.

When we get bloodwork, we’re doing various lab tests. Most commonly a complete blood count, or CBC, and a complete metabolic panel, or CMP. We often check other things as well, like troponin, d-dimer, LDH, ferritin, and CRP.  A complete blood count is specifically looking at 3 things: levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cells. We can see not only the total number of WBC, but also the breakdown of the percentages of the types of white blood cells, meaning, what percentage are neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.  Lymphocytes generally make up about 15-45% of WBC. This is very important as it pertains to COVID-19, and you’ll see why in a little bit. 

The CMP stands for the complete metabolic panel, and that is looking at levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, bilirubin, albumin, and liver enzymes like AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase. Some of these also have important implications when it comes to COVID 19 disease severity. Because In the recent study done at Temple University, they analyzed over 500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, all of which had inflammation in their lungs seen on CT scan of the chest (show). They determined the criteria for COVID 19 cytokine storm. For patients who met these criteria, their length of stay in the hospital was on average 15 days, compared to 6 days if they did not meet the criteria. 

Mortality was 28.8% in the group that met criteria, vs 6.6% in those who did not meet criteria. So if they met cytokine storm criteria, their likelihood of dying was 4 times higher. And how accurate was this prediction model? Pretty accurate, as this study had a specificity of 79% and a sensitivity of 85%, which is a lot of predictive power. Most of the patients who met the criteria for CS did so at the time of admission or shortly after. This suggests that there is an early and rapid progression in these patients, and also suggests that there is a low likelihood of developing cytokine storm after 10 days of hospitalization. 

So based on these specific lab parameters, this is how doctors can predict which patients are more likely to die of COVID-19. And I do find that this study correlates with what I’ve seen in my personal experience with hospitalized covid patients. And yes, the man whose CT scan I showed you earlier in this video, met all of these criteria for cytokine storm, and he did so as soon as 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital.","How Doctors Can Predict Who Dies From COVID"

Obesity in America:
In the United States, the obesity rate for adults is 31.8%. 

In Mexico, 70% of adults are overweight. Childhood obesity spiked 3x within the past ten years. Diabetes cases have doubled since the year 2000. No other country has experienced a rise in obesity of that magnitude.

How can knowledges of nixtamalization, the milpa, and maize cultures build and nourish resurgence in urban communities, transcend isolation, and reorient our technological imaginaries? How can lessons from previous epidemics, such as the AIDS crisis, help us prepare for mounting challenges ahead? With host Praba Pilar, featuring project collaborators Charlotte Sáenz and Ben Simmons. Hosted on Zoom by Pro Arts Gallery & Commons on Friday, October 20, 2020, with support from the Community Rapid Response Fund of Headlands Center for the Arts. In Part 1 of the webinar, Praba Pilar introduces the Techno-Tamaladas project, and Charlotte Maria Sáenz shares the concepts, practices and cosmologies of an integrated milpa. In Part 2 of the webinar, Ben Simmons shares lessons learned from the AIDS crisis, and Zoom participants dialogue and ask questions. This Zoom webinar was recorded and due to requests from certain participants, most of the participants are not shown in this documentation video.

Participant comments in the chat also included: 

- I recently watched POSE, which takes place during the AIDS epidemic. I was struck by some of the similarities to today. The need for cross-sector solidarity, accurate information, the marginalization and deaths of the most vulnerable populations…

- Ben, I appreciate hearing the history once again and making the connections between pandemics (and also Regan’s silence which is not unlike Trump’s disinformation , both so deadly.).

- I appreciate how both of you are highlighting the racial inequity of this current pandemic.

- Another similarity is the spontaneous creativity and mutual aid that arises in both times…from the hardest-hit communities themselves

- Over 35 yrs later and the backdrop to both AIDS and COVID remains the same, lack of a real public health system providing healthcare to all regardless of ability to pay. The ACA expanded coverage but millions have lost their employment based healthcare, and undocumented and many others still have no health care. Move to privatize VA (which helped Ben) continues apace.

- ¡Qué viva la milpa!

- I love how Praba described our location in relation to technology as ""astride"".  How do we get past the barbed wire of things like cell phones, the internet, and feeling each other inside the isolation (atomization) that technology creates?

- ¡Yay¡ Love Silvia  Cusicanqui!
desalambrar- I wonder if we might also think about the techno sphere itself as his alambrada

- Queridxs, muchas gracias por la conversación, reflexiones y seguir haciendo milpa!

- Me parece una forma muy interesante de llamar nuestra atencion a otra manera de ser y estar resaltando las formas de culturas indigenas y oponiendolas a las formas culturales dominantes en la actualidad.
- The Techno-Tamaladas draw on thousands of years of practice & knowledge cultivating corn/maize across the Americas to sustain life. Recognizing the Indigenous technology of nixtamalization - the Nahuatl word for steeping and cooking maize in water with ash or slaked lime - and how it increases nutritional value and reduces mycotoxins - provides a springboard to reimagine technological futurity. More information on the Techno-Tamaladas is available at https://www.prabapilar.com/technotama...



Speaker Bios:

Charlotte Maria Sáenz seeks to dislodge dominant narratives, expand perspectives, and grow common sense with her human and non-human communities. Towards these ends she tends an urban milpa, makes tortillas, and researches Zapatista pedagogies of seed as a doctoral researcher at ECOSUR in Chiapas, Mexico. She also teaches Interdisciplinary studies in an alternative Bachelors Completion Program at CIIS in San Francisco. Over the past 25 years she’s worked in diverse  media arts, cultural, and political education programs in refugee camps, schools, streets, and traveling programs.

Ben Simmons is a gay African-American video and media artist from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ben is a long term HIV+ survivor, was trained in medical surgical nursing in a short stint with the Navy, and before retiring, worked at John George Psychiatric Hospital in San Leandro, as the night charge nurse, for ten years.  

Praba Pilar is a diasporic Colombian artist disrupting the contemporary ‘Cult of the Techno-Logic’ through performances, digital and electronic installations, participatory workshops, and experimental public talks. The Techno-Tamaladas form part of Queercornu(c/t)opia - recent works with corn that queer the utopic, the planetary, entanglements, desire, and the ethics of care. These projects embrace temporary states: of utopias and cornucopias; of wonder; of dystopias, alienation and horror; of refusals, emergences, and possibilities.

Nestlé created United for Healthier Kids to raise awareness and take action on the issue. It is the largest initiative ever aiming at changing eating behaviors, gathering and galvanizing international partners to help raise a healthier generation of kids. Nutritionists, scientists and psychologists were invited to share their knowledge and POV to better understand the Mexican situation. But to help a whole nation change, we needed a bold, unique, fun and positive idea relying on strong local insights: people don't want to change for the sake of changing, they'll change to build a brighter future and give all the chances to the next generation of kids. 

Hermosa Esperanza was born. A positive and supportive nutritional & behavioral coaching approach with fun and creative solutions. Not focused on weight loss, but on changing daily behaviors. How? By creating a revolutionary TV show and a line of 14 products that makes healthier living fun for children and the whole family: maracas that shake away fat, a juicer you can wrestle with, a digital pet that grows, the more you move, a plate that helps control food portions at every age and much, much more.

""Today in Mexico we have 100,000 people who have lost their lives due to Covid-19,"" deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a news conference.

The health ministry announced 576 more deaths in its daily update, taking the total to 100,104, behind only the United States, Brazil and India.

The overall number of infections registered now stands at 1,019,543 in the nation of more than 128 million, up 4,472 from the previous day.

While the number of daily infections has begun to rise again in recent weeks, the authorities say that deaths remain on a downtrend.

""There are infections, but fortunately... there are fewer deaths and that's the aim,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said this week.
But Malaquias Lopez, an epidemiologist and former health ministry official, said it was unclear if the situation was improving.

""We're at a point where we don't see a clear phase of descent. We don't know where it's going,"" he told AFP.

The government says poor diets and health problems including obesity, hypertension and diabetes are partly to blame for the high death toll.

""These conditions increase the possibility of a patient dying, it's true, but in Mexico they're almost a death sentence,"" said Lopez, who thinks the authorities have used the risk factors to deflect criticism of their handling of the pandemic.

Half of Mexico's workforce is in the informal sector and if they become sick they cannot afford to self-isolate, he said.

The government says the high number of deaths reflects its large population.

When it comes to deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, Mexico is in 11th place worldwide, based on official data.

The authorities acknowledge that the real number of coronavirus deaths is higher than the official toll due to the low level of testing.

Luis Vargas, a doctor working at a coronavirus testing site in Mexico City, said that recently people seemed to have become more nervous because a relative or friend had caught the virus.

He fears that many shoppers neglected to follow sanitary measures during the country's equivalent of the Black Friday sales this month.

""I think the number of cases is going to increase,"" he said.

Eighteen-year-old Aaron Romero, who was waiting to be tested and has symptoms of Covid-19, said his family had agreed not to get together at Christmas this year.

""It's strange and difficult, but it's for the best,"" he said.","Mexico's Covid-19 deaths surpass 100,000"

It pitted a politically divided and militarily unprepared Mexico against the expansionist-minded administration of U.S. President James K. Polk, who believed the United States had a “manifest destiny” to spread across the continent to the Pacific Ocean. A border skirmish along the Rio Grande started off the fighting and was followed by a series of U.S. victories. When the dust cleared, Mexico had lost about one-third of its territory, including nearly all of present-day California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico.

Providing substantial weight loss, the Improved Gastric Sleeve has become a very popular bariatric procedure worldwide. The procedure is simple, however the failure rate can be upwards of 30% and can cause undesirable symptoms such as the most frequent, acid reflux. 

IGS is only available at Obesity Control Center where they have developed proprietary techniques to enhance the already existing sleeve procedure in 3 main ways: higher safety standards, less side effects, and less complications. 

With over 50 years of combined experience and 23,000 successful bariatric surgeries performed, Obesity Control Center, located in Tijuana, Mexico, is considered a world leader in weight loss surgery.

We're told that if we are overweight, it's because we can't control ourselves. Personal responsibility has been cited as a cause of obesity over and over again. If that were true one third of America should be considered irresponsible. Deborah Cohen debunks this myth and provides the real causes of the obesity epidemic and how we can stop them.

Dr. Cohen is a physician and Senior Scientist at the RAND Corporation and is the Principal Investigator of several studies on the intersection of the built environment and health.  She is the author of the new book ""A Big Fat Crisis—the Hidden Forces Behind the Obesity Epidemic—and How We Can End It"" and the co-author of the book, ""Prescription for a Healthy Nation—a new approach to improving our health by fixing our everyday world"". She is the lead researcher on several studies investigating ways to change the environment to reduce the burden of chronic diseases.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

The very first McDonald's restaurant appeared in Kuwait on a U.S. military base set up to support the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, the industry has rapidly expanded — there are now hundreds of U.S. fast food restaurants in Kuwait and as a result, the country has become one of the most obese nations on the planet. 

""The begining of fast food, I would say it is part of the Americanization of the culture here."" Dr. Mohsen Bagnied, a professor at the American University of Kuwait told VICE News. Now, Kuwait has roughly double the percentage of diabetic adults than the U.S. 

​The fast food industry isn't just operating in the Middle East. American Fast food brands populate more than 100 countries around the world, occupying six continents. And the global fast food industry is projected to be worth over $600 billion by 2019. 

VICE's Gianna Toboni travels to Kuwait to witness the health effects on a country deep in the throes of an unlikely obsession with U.S. fast food.

Buy Giles' book ""Gene Eating: The Story of Human Appetite"" now - https://geni.us/jnNxw0p

It is clear that the cause of obesity is a result of eating more than you burn. It is physics. What is more complex to answer is why some people eat more than others? Differences in our genetic make-up mean some of us are slightly more hungry all the time and so eat more than others. Giles Yeo explores how, in contrast to the prevailing view, obesity is not a choice. People who are obese are not bad or lazy; rather, they are fighting their biology.

Watch the Q&A: https://youtu.be/g5R7G_fU6cU

Dr Giles Yeo is a geneticist with over 20 years’ experience dedicated to researching the genetics of obesity. He obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge and assisted the ground-breaking research that uncovered key pathways in how the brain controls food intake.

His current research focuses on understanding how these pathways differ from person to person, and the influence of genetics in our relationship with food and eating habits. He is based at MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, where he is Principal Research Associate, and is a fellow and graduate tutor at Wolfson College.

This talk and Q&A was filmed in the Ri on 1 November 2019.

This is a list of countries ranked by the proportion of the population that is obese. The adult prevalence rate for obesity is defined as ""the percent of a country's population considered to be obese"". This obesity rate takes into account all adults with a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or above.

The top ten countries with the highest obesity rate: Micronesia, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Niue, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Palau, Cook Islands, Nauru.

The higher the BMI, the greater the risk of developing additional health problems. A healthy weight is considered to be a BMI of 24 or less. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 and above is considered obese.

Doctors we spoke with say there's more parents can do to help keep their kids on the right track. Dr. Rebecca Webb/Lovelace Westside Hospital, ""Kids model their parent's behaviors, kids want to be their parents. So what we do, our children will do, and we want them to be active, to be healthy, to eat good foods, to not sit and watch TV, to get out and move.""

http://www.placidway.com/medical-cent...

Gastric bypass surgery is considered a form of bariatric surgery, a field that deals with weight loss and obesity. Today, gastric bypass is generally performed using a technique called Roux-en-Y. This procedure reduces the size of the stomach to create a pouch that accepts no more than an ounce or so of food at a time. A small opening between the stomach and intestine allows food to travel directly to the large intestine. Gastric bypass surgery literally bypasses the bulk of the stomach and encourages massive weight loss in obese individuals.

Gastric bypass surgery enables individuals who have not responded to typical diet and exercise treatments to lose massive amounts of weight. In most cases, patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery are able to lose up to 80% of their excess body weight in one year. Because nearly 95% of weight-related health problems, called co-morbidities, include high blood pressure, diabetes, incontinence, and GERD, many patients find that such conditions have also been alleviated or eradicated as a result of the surgery.

32-year old Juan Pedro is from the central city of Aguascalientes, where he and his parents run a small shop, which provides the minimum income he has.
He was moved to Guadalajara for treatment on Tuesday, and was cheered by his neighbours as he walked the short distance from his bed to the van that would transport him there, with the help of special equipment. 
Gabriela Centeno, spokeswoman for the office of Dr. Jose Antonio Castaneda, confirmed the patient was taken to Guadalajara where blood samples were taken. 
Centeno said he will remain in the city for several months receiving treatment.
Mexican Manuel Uribe was once considered the world's heaviest man, before he died in 2014 at age 48.

If you are considering having weight loss surgery in Mexico, you probably have heard or read many of the prevailing myths about what bariatric surgery is or what your life after surgery will be like. Given the relatively poor outcomes associated with traditional approaches for treating obesity that include diet programs, behavioral modification, and pharmacotherapy, weight loss surgical procedures are a safe and effective option for those who meet selection criteria. Here are some common myths and misconceptions and the correct answers to them.
Misconception 1: Weight loss surgery is cosmetic surgery or a cop-out. Heavy individuals simply need to go on a strict diet.
This is not so. Science indicates that severe obesity is not self-inflicted or due to a lack of motivation. The ability to maintain long-term weight loss is almost impossible without bariatric procedures. Severely obese individuals are resistant to long-term weight-loss via diet and exercise. National Institutes of Health studies show that exercise, diet and behavior modifications fail at least 95% of the time. One of the reasons that bariatric procedures work is they cause biological changes that help reduce energy intake in the form of food and beverages resulting from anatomical changes to the stomach and digestive system that restrict food intake or cause malabsorption of nutrients (less nutrients get absorbed). Bariatric surgery also increases the production of certain hormones that reduce hunger and enhance the feeling of satiety (feeling full), while also reducing the production of ghrelin, the hunger-producing hormone. In these ways, bariatric surgery helps produce long-term weight loss.

Misconception 2: Only individuals who weigh more than 300 pounds can have weight loss surgery.
This is not necessarily true. One of the primary factors that qualify patients for bariatric surgery is body mass index, commonly known as BMI, the ratio of weight to height that also corresponds to risk calculations associated with obesity. Almost everyone with a BMI of more than 40 is considered a candidate. If your BMI is greater than 35 and you have been diagnosed with serious medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea, you will also be a likely candidate. Studies from the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health recommend that doctors factor in personal heal conditions in addition to your BMI, so even if it’s less than 35, you may still qualify.

Misconception 3: After surgery you’ll lose weight and be able to eat anything you want.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Weight loss surgery patients must follow a specific diet that progresses from clear liquids to full liquids and soft foods before reaching a so-called normal diet. Although you will be able to eat a variety of foods, portions will be smaller and there will be an emphasis on consuming protein. A return to grazing and other bad habits will cause weight gain.

Misconception 4: You have a greater risk of dying from weight loss surgery than dying from obesity.

Not so. Any surgery has associated risks, but as your body increases in size, so do your chances of dying from health-related complications. Mortality rates from many obesity-related diseases drop dramatically as you shed pounds.","Misconceptions About Weight Loss Surgery in Mexico"

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites.

RAPTOR is a flowchart-based programming environment, designed specifically to help students visualize their algorithms and avoid syntactic baggage. RAPTOR programs are created visually and executed visually by tracing the execution through the flowchart. Required syntax is kept to a minimum. Students prefer using flowcharts to express their algorithms, and are more successful creating algorithms using RAPTOR than using a traditional language or writing flowcharts without RAPTOR.

But, if we are to feed 10 billion people within planetary boundaries, the way food is produced and consumed needs to change. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated vulnerabilities in food systems – highlighting the insecurity of rural livelihoods, the tragedy of food loss and waste, and stark inequities in access to healthy food among the poor and vulnerable. It has also illustrated broadly the types of disruptions one can expect from the impact of climate change in years to come. With fewer than 10 years left to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Food Systems Summit in 2021 presents an opportunity to bring together stakeholders to address these challenges and unlock barriers to food systems transformation.

STORYLINE:
Anghella Torres is just 4 years old, but already she weighs 66 pounds (30 kilograms) - twice what she should. 
Even though she does not know how to read or count calories, she is on a diet. 
With the help of her grandmother and caretaker, Elizabeth Sucilla, Anghella is following a modest diet and exercise programme established for her by a nurse at a local public hospital earlier this year.
Mexico, which claims to have the fattest children in the world, is trying to encourage others to follow Anghella's lead. 
Public schools have banned junk food and are requiring more hours of physical education while the federal government has launched a media campaign that invites families to enrol their children in a public weight-loss programme.
The problem in Mexico is especially pronounced in the capital, Mexico City, and near the US -Mexico border, according to a study by Mexico's National Institute of Public Health.
Children and teenagers make up Mexico's largest age group, representing 39 percent of the country's 112 million people. 
More than 28 percent of children between five and nine, and 38 percent of pre-teens and teenagers ages 10 to 19, are overweight or obese, according to statistics from the Mexican Social Security Institute.
Dr Marisol Villegas, Director of the Weight and Size Programme of Mexico City's Health Department said this trend is worrisome and it might collapse the country's health system.

We are going to get back to basics on fat loss in this 5-part series. We are going to talk about a lot of things and it's going to be mostly science-based but I'm going to keep it simple.  I'm going to take complex things and break it down in a way that everybody can understand.  In this video we are going to kick off by talking about the terrible advice that has created the obesity epidemic in America.  It was about 1984 that we started getting told we needed a low-fat diet for health. This came from the government, medical institutions,  universities,  marketing companies right everybody said we needed to get on a low-fat diet if we wanted to be healthy.

In the other videos, I'm gonna talk about how we got here,  how we fat, how we burn fat, why counting calories doesn't work and then we're gonna give you a little bonus that is executive ketones.  You will also have a better understanding of fat metabolism than some doctors.

The phrase ""be strong, be kind"" has become a government motto and her speeches and social media posts travel far beyond New Zealand, often going viral across the world. In an election last month, she easily secured a second term.

She does, though, have critics and some say that she is failing the young and impoverished. 

This year, the UN children's agency annual report on child wellbeing placed New Zealand 35th out of 41 countries surveyed. The report found that 13 percent of the country's children were living in “material hardship” -  defined as unable to eat fresh food, visit doctors or pay bills on time. Worst affected were Indigenous Maori and Pacifika households with nearly one in four Maori children and one in three Pacifika children living in poverty.  And New Zealand has the second worst youth suicide rate in the developed world. 

Ardern responded to the report by pointing out it had not taken into consideration the NZ$5.5bn ""Families Package"" which her government says has lifted 18,400 children out of poverty. 

So what is really going on in New Zealand and why are so many children being left behind? In this episode of The Stream, we will ask those questions to a panel of experts and find out how they think the issue should be tackled.

Dieticians say a healthy diet and regular exercise is a better way to slim than relying on techniques such as the gastric balloon.
 new weapon in the fight against obesity is being launched in the UK - despite fears over its methods.

The system, designed by San Diego firm Obalon Therapeutics, allows a gastric balloon to be inserted into the stomach without invasive surgery.

The balloon is being launched in the UK after successful trials here and in the US.

What makes this system different from other gastric balloons is that it can be swallowed and then inflated without the need for anaesthetic or sedation.

It is packed inside a gelatine capsule that dissolves in the stomach and is inflated through a tube.

Then the tube is pulled out, allowing a self-sealing valve to keep the balloon inflated.

Two or even three balloons could be placed in the patient's stomach, and after three months they are removed using a traditional endoscopic procedure.

The balloon works by taking up space in the stomach, making the patient feel fuller after eating a reduced portion of food, and so reducing their calorific intake.

Helene Fleckney, from Shenley in Hertfordshire, has had two of the balloons inserted into her stomach during the product's trial.

OBESITY PILL
The balloon is inside a gelatine capsule that dissolves in the stomach
She told Sky News: ""Prior to having Obalon I weighed 11st 1lb and I'm now down to 9st 9lb, so that's 19lb lost.

""I'm delighted with that - it's made me feel so much better in myself.""

Some doctors and dieticians do have concerns about the use of gastric balloons.

They worry that it could lead to the overweight stopping trying to lose the pounds through diet and exercise, instead opting for a perceived ""quick fix"".

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ""What you really have to do is to do everything you can to maintain a proper weight, healthy living, healthy lifestyle so you never get up to a BMI of 27.""

Spire Hospital in Bristol is one of those providing the treatment, which costs from around £2,000, and is not available on the NHS.

Gastric surgeon Sally Norton says it should be seen as part of a regime of diet change and controlled weight loss.

""This is something that people can think 'This will get me out of that vicious circle of yo-yo dieting, of being completely unable to move the weight on my own'.

""This balloon will act to educate them about portion size, and retrain their brain and their mindset.

""It can help motivate them because they'll lose some of the weight on their own, and it will provide them with the tools to continue losing the weight once the balloon has come out after three months.""

The trials do back up the theory that this is a sound alternative to traditional gastric balloons.

The manufacturers claim that patients using this system averaged a 35.5% weight loss, compared with 20% for conventional balloons.

Dieticians though, insist prevention is better than cure, and that a healthy diet with regular exercise will mean never having to consider medical intervention in the first place.

It is predicted that half the UK population will be obese by 2050. Current research suggests that 25% of adults and 900,000 young people already are.","Obesity: Gastric Balloon Technology Launched"

In May 2011, AXA launched AXA People Protectors which is a Facebook page that enables anyone in the world to engage with other fellow People Protectors. It is where members can create and share ideas for projects aimed at protecting and making other people’s lives better.

November 2011 – AXA People Protectors in collaboration with NGO care replanted mangrove forests in an effort to fight the global warming effects happening in Vietnam. As a result, 4996 mangrove trees were planted with 14,550 residents protected from dramatic floods.

February 2012 – AXA People Protectors in collaboration with NGO care constructed 122 wells in response to Benin’s difficulty accessing water with 50% of the population having no access to clean water. This would result in 14,550 residents benefiting from the project.

June 2013 – AXA People Protectors launched the Kilos Malos vs. Kilos Sanos (Good Kilos vs. Bad Kilos) campaign as an answer to Mexico’s obesity concern which has already reached national levels. Online users were encouraged to cut calories transforming it into balanced food for kids with malnutrition. The campaign would later inspire 60,000 more people to join AXA People protectors: an abundant addition to its existing 100,000 protectors at the time.

January 2014 – AXA People Protectors reaches its 1 millionth mark with people protectors hailing from 49 countries. To date, the page has reached over 150 million people with the help of 1 million members who took on the extraordinary corporate responsibility to be people protectors.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYpFya5OE0&t=1s","(15 Nov 2020) Mexico has registered one million total coronavirus cases.
The country has a death rate of about 76 deaths per 100,000 people, with more health workers dying from COVID-19 than almost anywhere else in the world.
The country, with a population of about 130 million, has nearly 100,000 test-confirmed deaths, though because it has tested so few people officials suspect the real number is much higher, probably closer to 150,000.
Medical officials suspect that the country's lax attitude towards many internationally accepted practices in pandemic management, from face mask wearing, to lockdowns, testing and contract tracing, have led to the numbers seen on Saturday.  
Officials in Mexico claim science is on their side when it comes to a lack of testing, social distancing measures, and mask wearing. 
Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell claimed earlier in the year that any wider testing would be ""a waste of time"", and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador almost never wears a mask.
But international experts have consistently recommended mass testing, and say face masks protect both the wearer and other people.
""In May we already began to have empirical evidence and well-documented scientific studies began to appear stressing the importance of face masks and the need for testing,"" said former health secretary Dr. José Narro. 
Lopez Obrador's main promise to Mexicans is that there would be enough hospital beds for everyone who needs one, and his government has largely fulfilled that basic promise, even if Mexicans are so afraid of those hospitals they often wait until the last moment to go for treatment, at which point, doctors say, it's often too late. 
That resistance was what Mexico City human resources manager Lorena Salas felt when her 76-year-old father, Jaime Salas Osuna, began to show signs of what could be COVID-19.
Afraid he was going to get infected if he went to a hospital, she sped instead down to the resort city of Acapulco, where her father lived, and when she arrived, she found him thin, sweating and confused. 
Salas drove him to Mexico City where he underwent two operations, two intubations and struggled for 13 days before he died on October 20.
""I promised my father I was going to get him out of here alive, and even if it was for just a few hours, I fulfilled it,"" she recalled. ""Those were 45 days that God gifted me with.""
Mexico City is one of the few areas where the government's public message has changed; where officials once urged people with the disease to stay home as long as possible, they now advise those over 60 or with risk factors like diabetes or obesity to seek treatment immediately.  
Since the pandemic began, Mexico has managed to administer only about 2.5 million tests to its citizens; only seriously ill people get tested in Mexico. 
Testing only 1.9% of the population since the pandemic began has made it hard, if not impossible, to effective trace contacts, catch outbreaks early or identify asymptomatic cases.
Mexico City has tried an alternative approach, giving special attention to areas of high COVID-19 cases, setting up special kiosks in neighborhoods to provide some tests, with a few health workers have gone door-to-door looking for cases. 
Except for a few states, nobody in Mexico has attempted to enforce a lockdown or mandatory mask-wearing.
The closest thing most local authorities have done has been forcing workplaces to shut down, and fine or close businesses that allow too many customers inside at once.

http://www.placidway.com/medical-pack...

Sleeve gastrectomy is a type of bariatric surgery that drastically reduces the size of the stomach. Also known as a vertical gastrectomy, a partial gastrectomy, gastric reduction, as well as a greater curvature gastrectomy, this type of procedure is offered as an alternative to gastric bypass surgeries and encourages weight-loss in obese patients by removing up to 85% of the stomach. This is a permanent procedure that cannot be reversed, but one that is providing a growing number of obese patients from around the world with life-saving benefits.

Sleeve gastrectomy procedures are effective and safe for patients with high-risk and high BMI (body mass index) ranges. In many cases, this surgical procedure allows patients to lose 100 pounds or more, which helps to improve health and reduce medical issues that result from obesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, as well as the lack of mobility and quality of life.

Perhaps surprising to some, 70% of those who face overweight issues live in low- and middle-income countries, according to the latest research.

So what’s driving these trends? What do they mean for global development? And what can we do to address them? To find out, Expert Answers’ Paul Blake caught up with Meera Shekar, Global Lead for Nutrition at the World Bank.

Adult obesity levels are now higher in Mexico than the United States in official UN rankings, as the country battles to cope with changing lifestyles and diets.

A recent report by the United National Food and Agricultural Organisation found that almost a third of Mexicans - 32.8 per cent - were categorised as obese, compared to 31.8 per cent of Americans.  

More and more Mexicans are taking to guzzling fizzy drinks and downing junk food, turning their backs on the country's traditional fare of tortillas, beans and chilli. 

""The main cause of (the rise in obesity) is the deterioration of healthy habits. We are the country with the highest consumption of soft drinks in the world, 163 litres per person per year. Obviously, obesity is related to this but also to the abandonment of the traditional diet and the consumption of junk food,"" said Alejandro Calvillo, director of the consumer rights organisation El Poder del Consumidor. 

Weight-related diabetes is Mexico's biggest killer, reportedly claiming six times as many lives as the country's gang wars.

Obesity is now described as an epidemic, particularly hitting poorer communities, in tandem with malnutrition. 

""We have arrived at a point of no return. We either resolve it or we lose the country, the health system will collapse. The health system cannot collapse without the country collapsing too. We can now say it is a national security problem,"" said Dr Abelardo Avila of Mexico's National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition. 

Mexicans wryly call the problem Vitamin T after all the tacos and tostadas that are gobbled up.

Workers began burying the bodies of people who died with COVID-19 in Tijuana, the Mexican city with the most recorded cases of coronavirus on Monday. The burials began at graves located in the city's 13th pantheon. 
According to reports, it is the only pantheon in the city with the capacity to hold more bodies, thus in the following months construction of a new pantheon, number 14, will begin. 
Footage recorded on Monday shows gravediggers in protective suits and bulldozers digging pits and burying victims. Relatives of some of the deceased can also be seen in the pantheon, as well as rows of relatives of the sick in the city hospitals and the cordoned off beach. 
""They are bringing the bodies from COVID-19 [victims] and they are giving them a burial,"" explained Omar Martinez, one of the gravediggers, who added that ""a little more work [than usual] is coming."" 
Fernando Aragon, another of the gravediggers, explained that the victims of the coronavirus usually arrive in ""thermal bags"" and that some also arrive dead from ""pneumonia.”
According to data from the Mexican Ministry of Health, a total of 8,772 cases of COVID-19 have been registered in the country and 712 people have died so far.

The rabbi has been struggling with weight challenges for years, so his team of doctors reached out to David and the use of Ibogaine treatment to jumpstart his weight loss journey and recovery. Ibogaine treatment for obesity has been found useful for its ability to help the patients identify illness-causing negative beliefs that create unfavorable behaviors. With Ibogaine's two-fold process, he was able to heal both physically as the Ibogaine triggers the central nervous system enabling the body to begin healing itself and psychologically through Ibogaine's unique perceptual insight into the subconscious mind. With a solid continuum of care program, including behavioral coaching and nutritional education, the body and mind realign at a rate higher than any conventional treatment for higher, more sustainable outcomes. 

David Dardashti is one of the most experienced Ibogaine practitioners in the world, having treated more than 6000 patients the past twelve years at his Ibogaine Clinic in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.  David is the only practitioner we know of who treats Suboxone, Methadone, and Subutex addiction with Ibogaine without patients having to switch to short-acting opiates before treatment.

Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive substance found in a variety of plant species in the Apocynaceae family, principally Tabernanthe iboga. For this reason, ibogaine continues to generate a growing interest among medical professionals as well as the general public, especially those seeking alternatives to conventional modalities of treatment for SUDs.

Tuba Skinny is a traditional jazz street band based in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band's instrumentation includes cornet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, tenor banjo, guitar, frottoir, and vocals. The ensemble draws its inspiration from the early jazz, ragtime, and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The group began as an itinerant busking band and has performed around the world, including at music festivals in Mexico, Sweden, Australia, Italy, France,Switzerland, and Spain.

For over a decade, Tuba Skinny ""has grown steadily in popularity, releasing [ten] albums, frequently touring, and attracting high-profile fans from R. Crumb to Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman. They've garnered fans from all over the world—young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts."" Their albums have garnered multiple awards, and they have been hailed by Offbeat magazine, The Syncopated Times, and other publications as one of the best traditional early jazz bands performing today.

The band is popular on YouTube with ""more than 500 videos, many with 100,000-plus views, in a variety of languages."" However, the ensemble does not have an official YouTube page, and nearly all of the recorded footage is fan-made.The band's fan base has been described as possessing a ""lighthearted, fun, flapper vibe,"" a reflection of the Jazz Age time period evoked by their music.Despite the band's global fame and frequent performances in nightclubs and at jazz festivals, they have continued to perform on the streets of New Orleans and other cities in order to maintain their intimate connection with audiences.

Mexico has a 32.8 percent adult obesity rate, while the US has a rate 31.8 percent. The report stated that weight-related diabetes is on the rise, with almost one in six Mexican adults falling victim to the illness. Some 100,000 Mexicans are dying per year due to contracting diabetes.

The rise in obesity and related deaths has been ascribed to the increased consumption of fast food and sugary sodas. Mexican food is widely known to be calorific, with delicacies like burritos, nachos, tacos and quesadillas packing on the pounds. Dr. Abelardo Avila Curiel from the National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition traces the trend to the low cost of such produce, saying: ""For the first time in our history, we see individuals becoming obese and malnourished within just a few years. This is an extremely serious matter.""

Curiel stressed the importance of the food industry as a factor in the crisis, saying: ""Our food consumption habit is being ruled by the sector of the food industry that produces the so called junk food. This means food that has no positive nutritional value and which consumption, at the volumes we are ingesting them, is extremely harmful to our health. That means the obesity epidemic in our society cannot be explained without taking in consideration the exaggerated consumption of these products.""","Mexico: Mexico outweighs US on obesity scale"
