Operation Pacific Angel 2014-3 has kicked off in the Kingdom of Tonga. PACANGEL is a total force, joint and combined humanitarian assistance operation led by Pacific Air Forces. The operation includes general health, dental, optometry, pediatrics, and engineering programs as well as various subject-matter expert exchanges. 

Major Paul Kim
U.S. Air Force Public Health Officer

""Well one is to provide our services that they might not necessarily have day to day. However, more importantly, it's about building an international relationship. I know Tongans have deployed alongside with us in the past. So it's working together, trying to figure out what we can do better together."" 

Operation PACANGEL helps cultivate common bonds and foster goodwill between the U.S., Tonga, and several regional nations by conducting multilateral humanitarian assistance and civil military operations.  

Major Maama Misi
His Majesty's Armed Forces Operations Officer

""I appreciate very much the exercise and the assistance provided not only by the Americans but also to let us know that other foreign forces are here in Tonga for the Pacific Angel""

Israel ""IZ"" Kaʻanoʻi Kamakawiwoʻole (Hawaiian pronunciation: [kaˌmakaˌʋiwoˈʔole]; May 20, 1959 -- June 26, 1997) was a Hawaiian musician.
 
He became famous outside Hawaii when his album Facing Future was released in 1993. His medley of ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""What a Wonderful World"" was subsequently featured in several films, television programs, and television advertisement commercials.
 
Through his ukulele playing and incorporation of other genres (such as jazz and reggae), Kamakawiwoʻole's music remains a very strong influence in Hawaiian music.

Early life 
Kamakawiwoʻole was born at Kuakini Hospital in Honolulu to Henry Kaleialoha Naniwa Kamakawiwoʻole, Jr., and Evangeline Leinani Kamakawiwoʻole. He was raised in the community of Kaimuki, where his parents had met and married. He began playing music with his older brother Skippy and cousin Allen Thornton at the age of 11, being exposed to the music of Hawaiian entertainers of the time such as Peter Moon, Palani Vaughn, and Don Ho, who frequented the establishment where Kamakawiwoʻole's parents worked. Israel continued his path as his brother Skippy entered the Army in 1971 and cousin Allen parted ways in 1976 for the mainland.

In his early teens, he studied at Upward Bound (UB) of the University of Hawaii at Hilo and his family moved to Mākaha. There he met Louis ""Moon"" Kauakahi, Sam Gray, and Jerome Koko. Together with his brother Skippy they formed the Makaha Sons of Niʻihau. From 1976 throughout the 1980s, the Hawaiian contemporary band gained in popularity as they toured Hawaii and the continental United States and released fifteen successful albums.
 
In 1982, Kamakawiwoʻole's brother, Skippy, died of a heart attack. In that same year, Kamakawiwoʻole married his childhood sweetheart Marlene. Soon after, they had a daughter whom they named Ceslie-Ann ""Wehi"".

Throughout his life, Kamakawiwoʻole was obese and at one point weighed 757 pounds (343 kg; 54.1 st) standing 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall (BMI = 97.05 kg/m²).[7] He endured several hospitalizations because of problems caused by his obesity. Beset with respiratory and other medical problems, he died in Queen's Medical Center at 12:18 a.m. on June 26, 1997. Kamakawiwoʻole is survived by his widow, Marlene Kamakawiwoʻole, and their daughter, Ceslie-Ann ""Wehi"".
 
The Hawaii state flag flew at half-staff on July 10, 1997, the day of Kamakawiwoʻole's funeral. His koa wood coffin lay in state at the state capitol building in Honolulu. He was the third person in Hawaiian history to be awarded this honor, and the only one who was not a government official. Approximately ten thousand people attended the funeral. Thousands of fans gathered as his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean at Mākua Beach on July 12, 1997. The funeral and the scattering of Kamakawiwoʻole's ashes were featured in the official music video of ""Over the Rainbow"" released posthumously by Mountain Apple Company; as of June 2012, the video as featured on YouTube has garnered over 70 million views.
 
On September 20, 2003, hundreds paid tribute to Kamakawiwoʻole as a bronze bust of the revered singer was unveiled at the Waianae Neighborhood Community Center on Oʻahu. The singer's widow, Marlene Kamakawiwoʻole, and sculptor Jan-Michelle Sawyer were present for the dedication ceremony.","Israel Kamakawiwo'ole - His Famous Medley"

Dr Caroline Miller recognised the urgent need to find effective interventions to address how poor diet and obesity have overtaken smoking as Australia's leading preventable disease.
Australia is a world-leader in tobacco control and now has among the lowest rates of smoking in the world. This is due to tobacco control identifying smoking as more than a purely clinical/individual issue but rather as a public health problem requiring a public health response. Many lessons learned in reducing smoking may be applied to over-consumption of unhealthy food and beverages. Internationally, health agencies are investigating and implementing a range of interventions, including educative and regulatory measures.
Dr Caroline Miller is a Beacon Senior Research Fellow with the School of Public Health at The University of Adelaide and leads a research group at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI). The group she leads undertakes programs of research in public health, specialising in tobacco control, obesity prevention, alcohol, and the psychosocial impact of cancer.
Dr Caroline Miller has been involved in Australia’s major tobacco control initiatives including hard-hitting television campaigns, graphic warning labelling and Australia’s world-leading standardised tobacco packaging. She has qualifications in psychology, economics, and public health. Prior to joining SAHMRI and the University she was General Manager, Cancer Control at Cancer Council SA.","Executive Dean's Lecture Series | Dr Caroline Miller | 10 May 2017"

The fattest place on earth isn't in America.

The tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru holds that honor. At only 8.1 sq. miles, with a population of less than 10,000, the country's inhabitants have virtually become giants.

Ninety-five percent of the island's adult population is overweight, and 85 percent of the male adult population is obese, according to ABC News.

However, island natives haven't always been this fat. According to ABC, it wasn't until they began importing Western food that the population's size exploded. Now half of Nauruans suffer from Type II diabetes.","The Fattest Place on Earth"

The heightened interest is confirmation that traditional models of delivery, across fields such as health, are being challenged to consider human agency (the deep psychological roots of behaviour) and how it affects program implementation and delivery. With the global community seeking to deliver against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, there is an even greater demand to relook at current tools and models; rethinking approaches to incorporate behavioural insights. Delivering against these goals, are a major challenge, especially in the Pacific Island Countries, where both structural and capability constraints can thwart good intentions and well laid plans. In this keynote hear real-life field experience (the good, the bad and the ugly) on delivering a successful behaviour change campaign in Tonga over 3-4 years and perspectives on managing behaviourally focused regional programs from Canberra in the past year or so under DFAT's InnovationXchange (iXc).","Sipping coconuts and pot holes: implementing behaviour change programs in the Pacific"

Listening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading. Written language only began at around 3200 BC, but spoken language has existed long ago.

Learning by listening is a great way to:
- increases imagination and understanding
- improves your listening skills
- improves your own spoken accent
- learn while on the move
- reduce eye strain

Now learn the vast amount of general knowledge available on Wikipedia through audio (audio article). You could even learn subconsciously by playing the audio while you are sleeping! If you are planning to listen a lot, you could try using a bone conduction headphone, or a standard speaker instead of an earphone.

SUMMARY
=======
Tonga (; Tongan: [ˈtoŋa] Puleʻanga Fakatuʻi ʻo Tonga), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian country and archipelago comprising 169 islands, of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern Pacific Ocean. The sovereign state has a population of 100,651 people, of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.
Tonga stretches across approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north-south line. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest, Samoa to the northeast, Niue to the east, Kermadec (part of New Zealand) to the southwest, and New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the farther west.
Tonga became known in the West as the ""Friendly Islands"" because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.From 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected state status, with the United Kingdom looking after its foreign affairs under a Treaty of Friendship. The country never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power. In 2010, Tonga took a decisive path towards becoming a constitutional monarchy rather than a traditional absolute kingdom, after legislative reforms passed a course for the first partial representative elections.","Tonga | Wikipedia audio article"

It's a medical condition that raises the risk of certain illnesses and health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers.

Kiribati. ...

Despite obesity being a preventable condition, except in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia being overweight is the cause of more deaths worldwide than being underweight.

Weight is calculated via the Body Mass Index (BMI), which assesses a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height.

The United States ranks 18th on the list, with the UK faring significantly better at 43rd. The least overweight country in Europe is Switzerland, which placed 111th, narrowly beating France (108th), Denmark (107th), and Sweden (104th).

Obesity isn't limited to just one part of the world. Nations do have obese citizens everywhere. However, some have a considerably high proportion than others. These nations are listed as the World's Most Obese Nations. While some people think the world's richest and most developed countries are the most obese, that's not always the case. The United States and the United Kingdom are now two of the world 's politically wealthiest and most industrialized nations. However, when compared with other countries, they are only ranked 12th and 36th respectively.

1. Republic of Nauru: Percentage of population that is obese: 61%
Nauru has rapidly replaced its traditional diet of fresh fruit, fish, and vegetables with fried chicken and cola.

2. Cook Islands: 55.9%
Lurking behind the paradise of the Cook Islands is a deadly obesity epidemic.

3. Palau: 55.3%
Residents of Palau suffer from increased levels of life threatening diseases, such as hypertension.

4. Marshall Islands: 52.9%
Sixty years ago, diabetes was practically unheard of in the Marshall Islands.

Because the island is so small, a single tourist resort, fast-food chain, or trade deal has a much more profound effect on society than it would, say, in India.

6. Niue: 50%
Nine of the world's ten most obese countries are in the Pacific.

7. Tonga: 48.32%
Up to 40% of the Tongan population has type 2 diabetes.

8. Samoa: 47.3%
In the 1950s, U.S. poultry farms began dumping unwanted fatty turkey tails into markets in Samoa, where they soon became a Samoan favorite.

9. Kiribati: 46%

Australia is known for its active outdoor lifestyle, but that image has been damaged by recent research which shows obesity is on the rise.

The Obesity Policy Coalition says 75 per cent of all Australians will be fat within 20 years.

The health group has come up with some unusual proposals to battle the bulge.

Children of obese and overweight women have a higher risk of early cardiovascular death as adults, finds a study published on bmj.com today.

The findings highlight the urgent need for strategies to prevent obesity in women of childbearing age and the need to assess the offspring of obese mothers for their cardiovascular risk, say the authors.

Rates of maternal obesity have risen rapidly in the past two decades. In the United States, about 64% of women of reproductive age are overweight and 35% are obese, with a similar pattern in Europe.

Many studies have shown a link between maternal obesity and disease later in life, but it is still not clear whether maternal obesity is associated with increased death in offspring from cardiovascular causes.

Using birth and death records from 1950 to the present day, a team of researchers in Scotland identified 28,540 women - whose body mass index (BMI) was recorded at their first antenatal visit - and their 37,709 offspring.

BMI was defined as underweight (BMI 18.5 or less), normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and obese (BMI 30 or more).

Relevant details about the pregnancy were collated, including the mother's age at delivery, number of previous pregnancies, mother and father's social class and infant sex, birth weight and gestation at delivery.

Among the mothers, 21% were overweight and 4% were obese. Among the 37,709 offspring there were 6551 deaths from any cause.

After adjusting for several factors, the researchers found a 35% increased risk of premature death in the adult offspring of obese mothers.

They also found a 29% increased risk of a hospital admission for a cardiovascular event in the adult offspring of obese mothers compared with offspring of mothers with normal BMI.

The offspring of overweight mothers also had a higher risk of adverse events later in life.

It is thought that being overweight in pregnancy may cause permanent changes in appetite control and energy metabolism in the offspring, leading to a greater risk of heart problems later in life.

With rising rates of excess weight among pregnant women, the authors say their findings are ""a major public health concern"" and indicate that the offspring of obese mothers are a high risk group who should be assessed for cardiovascular risk, and actively encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

""As one in five women in the UK is currently obese at antenatal booking, strategies to optimise weight before pregnancy are urgently required,"" they conclude.","Children of obese mothers at greater risk of early heart death as adults"

SUMMARY
=======
Tonga (; Tongan: [ˈtoŋa] Puleʻanga Fakatuʻi ʻo Tonga), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian country and archipelago comprising 169 islands, of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern Pacific Ocean. The sovereign state has a population of 100,651 people, of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.
Tonga stretches across approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north-south line. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest, Samoa to the northeast, Niue to the east, Kermadec (part of New Zealand) to the southwest, and New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the farther west.
Tonga became known in the West as the ""Friendly Islands"" because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.From 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected state status, with the United Kingdom looking after its foreign affairs under a Treaty of Friendship. The country never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power. In 2010, Tonga took a decisive path towards becoming a constitutional monarchy rather than a traditional absolute kingdom, after legislative reforms passed a course for the first partial representative elections.","Tonga | Wikipedia audio article"

Adult obesity levels are now higher in Mexico than the United States in official UN rankings, as the country battles to cope with changing lifestyles and diets.

A recent report by the United National Food and Agricultural Organisation found that almost a third of Mexicans - 32.8 per cent - were categorised as obese, compared to 31.8 per cent of Americans.  

More and more Mexicans are taking to guzzling fizzy drinks and downing junk food, turning their backs on the country's traditional fare of tortillas, beans and chilli. 

""The main cause of (the rise in obesity) is the deterioration of healthy habits. We are the country with the highest consumption of soft drinks in the world, 163 litres per person per year. Obviously, obesity is related to this but also to the abandonment of the traditional diet and the consumption of junk food,"" said Alejandro Calvillo, director of the consumer rights organisation El Poder del Consumidor. 

Weight-related diabetes is Mexico's biggest killer, reportedly claiming six times as many lives as the country's gang wars.

Obesity is now described as an epidemic, particularly hitting poorer communities, in tandem with malnutrition. 

""We have arrived at a point of no return. We either resolve it or we lose the country, the health system will collapse. The health system cannot collapse without the country collapsing too. We can now say it is a national security problem,"" said Dr Abelardo Avila of Mexico's National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition. 

Mexicans wryly call the problem Vitamin T after all the tacos and tostadas that are gobbled up.

Commissioned by the University of Otago's Edgar National Centre for Diabetes and Obesity Research, this video highlights the devastating impact obesity can have on individual health and the unbearable strain an unchecked epidemic will put on New Zealand's health services.

The video explores how to change the current ""obesogenic"" environment -- which provides easy access to far too much energy-dense food and does not encourage physical activity -- to one which supports people to make healthier lifestyle choices.

Features comment by leading obesity researchers and interviews including a School Principal, MPs and the Managing Director of McDonald's New Zealand.","The Obesity Epidemic in New Zealand"

A hypoglycemia diet operates by slowing down that fee in which the body soaks in glucose, which in turn causes our bodies to burn calories which can be stored in your fat tissues.
You need to understand exactly what hypoglycemia is needed to have a successful hypoglycemia diet program. Hypoglycemia is a condition the location where the blood sugar levels (or sugar levels) become too low within the body and ultimately your brain, which leads to a variety of unpleasant symptoms including: tiredness, blurred vision, quick heart rate, headache...etc. This can be due to glucose being released also slowly into the blood vessels or by a lot of insulin being released to the bloodstream. A blood sugar level that is with or below 70mg/dL is recognized as low and can become harmful to the body. Make sure you consult your physician prior to starting a hypoglycemia diet, there could be certain foods or strategies that you need to avoid.","HQ Poasi's Story -- Faces of Diabetes (Tongan) Part 1"

With almost two-thirds of Australian adults tipping the scales as overweight or obese, The Obesity Myth will break down barriers to social cohesion by challenging commonly held views of obesity. The Doctors at Austin Health are taking a different approach by treating obesity as a chronic genetic disease. Patients are told, often for the first time in their life, their weight problems are not their fault, but often primarily the result of a genetic predisposition. The Austin's treatment regimen, which is a last resort for many patients who are at risk of early death due to their weight, uses a combination of diet, medication and bariatric surgery to transform bodies and lives.","The Obesity Myth Part 1"

Promoting health and fighting Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD). Ma'a Lahi TV aims to address the NCD crisis in Tonga.
 The problem of NCDs is at a critical level in Tonga. With an increasing number of Tongans being affected by heart disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and smoking-related illnesses, Tonga Health was established to combat this burden of disease and promote healthy lifestyle changes throughout Tonga.
 Tonga Health uses evidence-based approaches to increase the knowledge, skills and resources of key organisations through advocacy for and promotion of healthy environments and healthy living.
What are NCDs?
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are not passed from person to person. They are of long duration and generally slow progression. The 4 main types of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. These 4 groups of diseases account for 82% of all NCD deaths. Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of dying from an NCD.","SIMPLE HEALTHY EATING | TONGA MISSION SDA CONFERENCE  | MA'A LAHI TV"

Murray Huff, a vascular biology scientist at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, along with Erin Mulvihill, a PhD student, studied the effects of a flavonoid in tangerines called Nobiletin.  Their research is published in the journal Diabetes.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.

Hover over a country for details.
In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Pregnant women that are obese may suffer from complications that can lead to health problems for the mother or child. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.

Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their tradition cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:

Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)
Tonga (Average BMI: 31.9)
Samoa (Average BMI: 31.7)
Kuwait (Average BMI: 30)
Saint Kitts and Nevis (Average BMI: 29.7)
Saint Lucia (Average BMI: 29.6)
Kiribati (Average BMI: 29.6)
Palau (Average BMI: 29.4)
Micronesia (Average BMI: 29.4)
Tuvalu (Average BMI: 29.3)

If you know me, then you'll know that nothing excites me more than visiting obscure places…  Nauru is my 155th country, and maybe the most interesting one yet, and I cannot wait to tell you all about it!!   PSA: NAURU IS AMAZING!

In this brief video you can find seven little known facts about Tonga.

More information about the video content bellow: 
1. Tonga became known in the West as the Friendly Islands because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.

2. The primary island, Tongatapu, has a number of tricks up its sleeve, such as the spectacular blowholes along the south western coastline. You’ll find four miles of coast with countless blowholes that can spout water 30 meters high. Go ahead and take bus from Nukualofa towards the village of Houma (Half an hour) and make sure to be there at high tide for any truly spectacular view.

3. The current royal dynasty of Tonga was founded in 1831 by Taufa’ahau Tupou, who took the name George I. He consolidated the kingdom by conquest and in 1875 granted a constitution. Tonga became independent on June 4, 1970. The government is largely controlled by the king, his nominees, and a small group of hereditary nobles.
 
4. Not much is known before European contact because of the lack of a writing system, but oral history has survived and been recorded after the arrival of the Europeans. By the 12th century, Tongans and the Tongan paramount chief, the Tuʻi Tonga, had a reputation across the central Pacific—from Niue, Samoa, Rotuma, Wallis & Futuna, New Caledonia to Tikopia—leading some historians to speak of a Tuʻi Tonga Empire.

5. Despite being a small country, Tonga has its own army. Furthermore, it participated in WWI, as part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, and in WWII. In recent times, Tongan soldiers were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq and participated in several peace keeping missions.

6. Located in Oceania, Tonga is an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, directly south of Samoa and about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand. Its 169 islands, 36 of them inhabited cover an 800-kilometre-long north-south line. The largest island, Tongatapu, is where the capital city of Nukuʻalofa is located.

7. The Free Wesleyan Church is the largest Methodist denomination in Tonga, and also the state church. Everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian faith; for example, all commerce and entertainment activities cease on Sunday, from the beginning of the day at midnight, to the end of the day at midnight. The constitution declares the Sabbath sacred forever.

Which countries are most obese nations in the world ?

A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.

In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Pregnant women that are obese may suffer from complications that can lead to health problems for the mother or child. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.

Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their traditional cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:
Here is the list of World's Most Obese Countries:

Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)
Tonga (Average BMI: 31.9)
Samoa (Average BMI: 31.7)
Kuwait (Average BMI: 30)
Saint Kitts and Nevis (Average BMI: 29.7)
Saint Lucia (Average BMI: 29.6)
Kiribati (Average BMI: 29.6)
Palau (Average BMI: 29.4)
Micronesia (Average BMI: 29.4)
Tuvalu (Average BMI: 29.3)

Thirty years of rising living standards have left Qatar with an epidemic of obese children. Now doctors are trying to tighten belts and stem the tide on a major health problem that could have far reaching consequences.

At the beginning I was fine, until I was in the third year at primary school. Then the Gulf tummy started to grow explains Moaz, who suffered from obesity all through his childhood. A sharp rise in economic affluence, increasingly westernized diets and low exercise rates has lead to an explosion in the country's levels of obesity. 40% of Qataris are now obese and 20% suffer from diabetes, with 75% of diabetics under 45 years of age. As Dr Taheri explains, the effects could be far reaching. ""They are going to be affected at a very young age with heart disease, problems with cancer, dementia, things that are going to affect the nation in the long term."" Doctors like Taheri are hoping that a strict program of prevention, enforcing healthy diets and exercise regimes upon the nation's schoolchildren will be enough to limit the impact.

Mexico has a 32.8 percent adult obesity rate, while the US has a rate 31.8 percent. The report stated that weight-related diabetes is on the rise, with almost one in six Mexican adults falling victim to the illness. Some 100,000 Mexicans are dying per year due to contracting diabetes.

The rise in obesity and related deaths has been ascribed to the increased consumption of fast food and sugary sodas. Mexican food is widely known to be calorific, with delicacies like burritos, nachos, tacos and quesadillas packing on the pounds. Dr. Abelardo Avila Curiel from the National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition traces the trend to the low cost of such produce, saying: ""For the first time in our history, we see individuals becoming obese and malnourished within just a few years. This is an extremely serious matter.""

Curiel stressed the importance of the food industry as a factor in the crisis, saying: ""Our food consumption habit is being ruled by the sector of the food industry that produces the so called junk food. This means food that has no positive nutritional value and which consumption, at the volumes we are ingesting them, is extremely harmful to our health. That means the obesity epidemic in our society cannot be explained without taking in consideration the exaggerated consumption of these products.""","Mexico: Mexico outweighs US on obesity scale"

Reporter Matai O’Connor went along for a walk up Kaiti Hill the other day to see what it’s all about. Encouraging people to work out and eat healthily can be a challenge, but a Gisborne nurse has used her initiative to help over 40 Pasifika families turn their lives around.

http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/video
https://www.facebook.com/gisbornehera...
https://www.youtube.com/gisborneherald

Ministry of Health statistics state that in the year July 2018 to June 2019, 87 percent of the Pacific community were overweight or obese.

Pasifika people also have the highest percentage of diabetes out of all ethnicities — 11.2 percent have diabetes, and 14.6 percent have type 2 diabetes.

Nurse Mele Fonua Veituna sees the real life impacts of these statistics in her work on the medical ward at Gisborne Hospital.

The health issues motivated her to create a challenge for Pacific Island communities to become healthier.

It started in May when New Zealand moved down from Alert Level 4 to 3. May is special for the Tongan community — the first Sunday of the month is a celebration for children, the second Sunday is mothers' day and the third Sunday is fathers' day.

They couldn't go to church to celebrate as they would have normally, and so Mele thought about creating a Facebook challenge.

She asked people to do 30 push-ups for 30 days and post videos of themselves to prove they actually did the work.

“One of the fathers was 66 years old. It was absolutely amazing he was doing it every day,” she said.

Her father died of heart failure, which motivated her to do something to remember him for fathers day and hopefully help people become healthier.

There was a prize for the winner of that first challenge, but Mele said it was too hard to figure out who to give it to so she decided to put it to a vote. But that turned out to be too hard to decide too, so everyone got a prize for their efforts.

Once that challenge ended, people asked Mele, “well, what's next?”

“That's when I decided to carry on and turn this into a weight loss, healthy eating challenge,” Mele said.

At the end of May, 26 Tongan people signed up to be part of the first round of the six-week Healthy Challenge, or as it is in Tongan, “Pole ki he mo'ui lelei”. They were asked to register with $20 to help pay for the prizes and any other costs involved.

Three months on, participants are in their third round of six weeks, and into their third week.

A new challenge is posted each week. In this round, the first was “lose yourself at winter” with a focus on obesity. In the second week diabetes awareness was the focus, and the third and current round is stroke awareness, “because a stroke can happen at anytime,” Mele said.

As a way to keep everyone accountable and to make sure they are working out, Mele made a private Facebook group where the participants can express themselves however they want without the fear of judgement from random people online.

Friends of Mele online also joined in on the challenge. A family living in America and another in Australia have joined in too.

And there are members throughout New Zealand, in Auckland, Rotorua, Wellington and the South lsland.

“This is for everyone and anyone, I just want to help our people get healthier.”

The challenge is open to everyone. Anyone can join in no matter who they are but only as long as they are wanting to become healthy.

Families and friends
The group often “go live” when walking up Kaiti Hill.

During the first round people lost from 6kg to 23.4kg in the six weeks.

“That is a lot coming from not losing anything,” Mele said.

After the success of the first round, they said to Mele “please can we keep doing this, maybe even till December so we look good for summer”. So Mele decided to keep doing it.

“It is hard for Pacific Island communities to raise their hand and ask for help but for some reason everyone enjoys doing this,” Mele said.

In the second round 62 people joined up, including children and teenagers.

Some over-50-year-olds have stayed from the first round.

“They are all into this. They are going out there by themselves or in groups, and doing the exercises they need to do,” Mele said.

Lupe Grant joined in the first challenge and has stuck with it since, helping Mele with anything she needs to keep the challenge going.

A part of the challenge is a weekly recipe that Mele posts in the Facebook group.

There is no set routine. There is only the recipe.

They can do whatever they want, it is not forced upon them.

The Les Mills HAKA premiered at the 2008 Global Summit in a performance led by Poara Sharples and Steve Renata and a fearsome team of eye-rolling, foot-stomping LMI members. It was greeted with rapturous applause from an International audience that included the NZ Prime Minister Helen Clark .

Steve says the LMI team wanted to create a haka with a clear, compelling message about overcoming obesity and sedentary lifestyles as one tribe. 

Best-known as a war dance performed by men, haka are also performed at ceremonies and as a welcome, and -- like the LES MILLS haka - can be performed by a group that includes women. 

To ensure all cultural traditions and protocols were adhered to Les Mills International commissioned Paroa Sharples (Ngati Kahungunu) New Zealand's leading Kapa Haka specialist to choreograph and train the launch team.

The LES MILLS haka will become an important part of all Les Mills training sessions and the unique culture that is Les Mills.","Les Mills International  Haka"

While there are many reasons which can lead to the cause of obesity, one way we must look at as a community is the ""local"" style of eating.

These photos come from Senegal, where young men and women have been sharing photos of themselves eating WAY too much junk food...using the hashtag ""I'm preserving my health"". That sounds contradictory, but in fact, they're using humour to get this message across to their peers: ""if you want to have diabetes and high blood pressure, be like me: don't exercise, and eat foods with too much sugar, salt, and fat"". Each person then tags their friends, and challenges them to post their own pictures. 
It's all part of a campaign by doctors to get Senegalese youth to eat more healthily. As the country develops, Senegal is seeing a rise in its rate of adults who are overweight - 46 percent more than in 1990. Fast food has become more prevalent; increasingly sedentary lifestyles are also to blame.
But Senegal is far from the only country where waistlines are growing…
In the past three decades, the rates of people who are overweight have more than doubled in Ivory Coast and Ghana... Same story in several countries in Asia, including China, Bangladesh and Vietnam... Vietnam is the fast-fattening population in the world, with a 125 percent rise! 
Still, these countries are far from having the world's most overweight populations.. Contrary to popular belief, it's not the United States, which comes in 27th place... At the top of the list are the Pacific island nations of Tonga, Samoa and Kiribati They're followed by Kuwait, Qatar, and Egypt.  
Senegal is still toward the bottom of the list, but its doctors believe that the best way to fight a disease - is prevention through education.

Listening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading. Written language only began at around 3200 BC, but spoken language has existed long ago.

Learning by listening is a great way to:
- increases imagination and understanding
- improves your listening skills
- improves your own spoken accent
- learn while on the move
- reduce eye strain

Now learn the vast amount of general knowledge available on Wikipedia through audio (audio article). You could even learn subconsciously by playing the audio while you are sleeping! If you are planning to listen a lot, you could try using a bone conduction headphone, or a standard speaker instead of an earphone.

SUMMARY
=======
Tonga (; Tongan: [ˈtoŋa] Puleʻanga Fakatuʻi ʻo Tonga), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian country and archipelago comprising 169 islands, of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern Pacific Ocean. The sovereign state has a population of 100,651 people, of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.
Tonga stretches across approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north-south line. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest, Samoa to the northeast, Niue to the east, Kermadec (part of New Zealand) to the southwest, and New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the farther west.
Tonga became known in the West as the ""Friendly Islands"" because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.From 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected state status, with the United Kingdom looking after its foreign affairs under a Treaty of Friendship. The country never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power.

Obesity and diseases linked to it are now killing more people than hunger, according to findings of a major global health study by the Lancet magazine, based in the UK.

It found that the average lifespan for women is highest in Japan - at 86 - and lowest in Haiti at 44.

Men in Iceland live to 80 on average, but in Haiti the figure is just 33.

Heart attacks and strokes are still the biggest killers - accounting for one in four deaths worldwide.

Alcohol abuse is on the rise - killing a record number of people, particularly young men in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.

The report labels Latin America ""the homicide belt"" as a rising number of men are being killed by violence.

In developed countries in Asia, suicide has become a leading cause of death.

And whereas childhood malnutrition was the number one risk factor for early death in 1990, it is now down to eighth place - behind obesity.

Al Jazeera's Jessica Baldwin reports from London.

(obese, fat... whatever term you choose)  Maybe they aren't a special interest group, but they seem to be totally up for grabs when it comes to discrimination.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.","World Obesity Rates (2020)"

The culture of its inhabitants has surely changed greatly over this long time period. Before the arrival of European explorers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Tongans were in frequent contact with their nearest Oceanic neighbors, Fiji and Samoa. In the 19th century, with the arrival of Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed dramatically. Some old beliefs and habits were thrown away and others adopted. Some accommodations made in the 19th century and early 20th century are now being challenged by changing Western civilization. Hence '''Tongan culture''' is far from a unified or monolithic affair, and Tongans themselves may differ strongly as to what it is Tongan to do, or not do.

Desde hace mucho tiempo se creía que la obesidad era un problema existente únicamente en los países de ingreso alto. Sin embargo, más del 70 % de los 2000 millones de personas obesas o con sobrepeso vive en países de ingreso bajo y mediano. Dado que este problema se traduce en mayores niveles de discapacidad y mortalidad, altos costos de la atención médica y menor productividad, la obesidad es motivo de creciente preocupación para todos los países, independientemente de su nivel de ingreso.

The Pacific Islands can appear like an idyllic palm-fringed paradise. But many of these tiny and isolated countries are struggling to survive, facing weak governance, unemployment and faltering economies. 

They also face a health crisis - obesity. Until the mid-20th century, most Pacific islanders survived on a diet of fish, fruit and vegetables. But with globalisation and a more sedentary lifestyle, today the Pacific is home to eight of the 10 fattest countries on earth. 

On this edition of 101 East, we ask: What is the future of the islands of the South Pacific?

Striae distensae (SD) or stretch marks are common dermal lesions which arise due to the stretching of the dermis.1 There are two forms of SD; striae rubrae and striae albae.2 The acute stage (striae rubrae) is characterized by the initial erythematous, red and stretched flat (in some cases appear slightly raised) lesions which are aligned perpendicular to the direction of skin tension and can be symptomatic, whilst the chronic stage (striae albae) is classified when SD have faded and appear atrophic, wrinkled, and hypopigmented .

As mentioned above, it is my personal recommendation. I applied it from 8th week of pregnancy till the date of delivery and consumed about four 50 gm packs. However, the indication is that you have to apply the cream till about a few weeks after delivery.

After delivery, I was a bit dejected seeing my huge belly that looked like the baby was still inside. I thought it would remain that way forever and just gave up on the cream. But thanks to the maternity wrap belt, my belly was almost back to the pre-pregnancy stage after about 3 months, albeit with a few stretch marks.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqAKUTF-Y-8","It has become conventional wisdom that the global obesity epidemic is the result of an overabundance of calories in the modern world. This is sometimes framed as an “evolutionary mismatch,” in which technology has made it easier than ever for food producers to satisfy the evolved human predilections for fats, sweets, and salts. Some have gone so far as to conclude that product quality and food industry marketing practices have not played significant roles in the epidemic, and indeed that perhaps the rise in obesity should be viewed as simply a sign of progress.

This presentation will argue that a more nuanced understanding of the physiology of fat deposition and the natural history of dietary choice suggests that the modern market for food may in fact be fundamentally broken. This conclusion can be grounded in fundamental economic principles, and is supported by a wide array of evidence from the biomedical and behavioural sciences.","""Beyond Calories: Obesity, Dietary Choice, and the Economics of Information"" - Dr Trent Smith PhD"

Thirty years of rising living standards have left Qatar with an epidemic of obese children. Now doctors are trying to tighten belts and stem the tide on a major health problem that could have far reaching consequences.

At the beginning I was fine, until I was in the third year at primary school. Then the Gulf tummy started to grow explains Moaz, who suffered from obesity all through his childhood. A sharp rise in economic affluence, increasingly westernized diets and low exercise rates has lead to an explosion in the country's levels of obesity. 40% of Qataris are now obese and 20% suffer from diabetes, with 75% of diabetics under 45 years of age. As Dr Taheri explains, the effects could be far reaching. ""They are going to be affected at a very young age with heart disease, problems with cancer, dementia, things that are going to affect the nation in the long term."" Doctors like Taheri are hoping that a strict program of prevention, enforcing healthy diets and exercise regimes upon the nation's schoolchildren will be enough to limit the impact.

Abstract:   

Since 1960, the mortality profiles of industrialized countries have been dominated by the chronic diseases of adulthood. The intensity of these diseases reflects many factors, including scientific understanding of disease etiology, access to and performance of health care systems, levels of education and income, and individual behaviors affecting health. This paper examines mortality levels in the United States and other industrialized countries since 1960 and considers the extent to which smoking and obesity are contributors to trends, international differences, and internal disparities. Following the lead of Matilda White Riley, we adopt a life cycle approach to the analysis and stress the importance of behaviors cumulated over a lifetime. While there is considerable consensus about smoking’s effects on longevity, there is a great deal of uncertainty and contention about the effects of obesity. This paper presents new findings on the impact of obesity over the life course on mortality and concludes that obesity is a greater threat to health than is sometimes asserted and considers how declining smoking and rising obesity are likely to affect future levels of longevity in the United States.","7th Matilda White Riley Lecture in the Behavioral and Social Sciences"

Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as ""natural"", ""non-invasive"", and as promoting ""self-healing"". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine. Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against following modern medical practices, including but not limited to medical testing, drugs, vaccinations, and surgery. Instead, naturopathic study and practice rely on unscientific notions, often leading naturopathic doctors to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit.Naturopathic medicine is considered by the medical profession to be ineffective and possibly harmful, raising ethical issues about its practice.In addition to accusations from the medical community, such as the American Cancer Society,naturopaths and naturopathic doctors have repeatedly been accused of being charlatans and practicing quackery.Over the years, many practitioners of naturopathic medicine have been found criminally liable in the courts of law around the world. In some countries it is a criminal offense for naturopaths and naturopathic doctors to label themselves as medical professionals.

https://youtu.be/01QQWQGGFoI


Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat addition that may ruin health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).
Adults
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:
• Overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
• Obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.


What causes obesity and overweight?
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been:
• an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat; and
• an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.


Record numbers of Americans are obese, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 70% of Americans are now either obese or overweight by this measure. However, the statistics are particularly worrying. Almost 40% of adults are obese. The childhood obesity rate, for ages 6-19, has increased to 20%.
Childhood obesity is linked to increased mortality rates in adulthood, and obesity can lead to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
It’s hardly a uniquely American problem though — the World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the number of obese kids and adolescents has risen tenfold over the last four decades, around the world.

Processed Foods Are Universal
Americans who are poor and obese don’t live in a food desert, they may live in an area where frozen corn dogs sold at the local dollar store are more affordable than fresh fruits and vegetables sold in a supermarket.
Nonstop Stress
From job insecurity and high unemployment to a dysfunctional health insurance system, life has becoming increasingly stressful in the U.S.—and research shows a strong link between stress and weight gain.
Poor Work/Life Balance
Seven Powerful Ideas That Influence the Way We Think has pointed out that obesity is one of the results of Americans’ poor work/life balance.
Lack of Universal Healthcare
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 has given millions of previously uninsured Americans access to health insurance. But millions of other Americans remain uninsured, and cut off from things that discourage obesity, such as programs promoting wealth loss or weight management. 
Powerful Junk Food Lobby
The lobby that’s doing the most to promote poor health may very well be the junk food lobby, which spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy in Washington, DC. 

WHO response
Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2004, the ""WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health"" describes the actions needed to support healthy diets and regular physical activity. The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.

Listening is a more natural way of learning, when compared to reading. Written
language only began at around 3200 BC, but spoken language has existed long ago.

Learning by listening is a great way to:
- increases imagination and understanding
- improves your listening skills
- improves your own spoken accent
- learn while on the move
- reduce eye strain

Now learn the vast amount of general knowledge available on Wikipedia through
audio (audio article). You could even learn subconsciously by playing the audio
while you are sleeping! If you are planning to listen a lot, you could try using

SUMMARY
=======
Tonga (; Tongan: [ˈtoŋa] Puleʻanga Fakatuʻi ʻo Tonga), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian country and archipelago comprising 169 islands, of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about 750 square kilometres (290 sq mi) scattered over 700,000 square kilometres (270,000 sq mi) of the southern Pacific Ocean. The sovereign state has a population of 100,651 people, of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.
Tonga stretches across approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) in a north-south line. It is surrounded by Fiji and Wallis and Futuna (France) to the northwest, Samoa to the northeast, Niue to the east, Kermadec (part of New Zealand) to the southwest, and New Caledonia (France) and Vanuatu to the farther west.
Tonga became known in the West as the ""Friendly Islands"" because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.From 1900 to 1970, Tonga had British protected state status, with the United Kingdom looking after its foreign affairs under a Treaty of Friendship. The country never relinquished its sovereignty to any foreign power. In 2010, Tonga took a decisive path towards becoming a constitutional monarchy rather than a traditional absolute kingdom, after legislative reforms passed a course for the first partial representative elections.","Tonga | Wikipedia audio article"

Their story begins in Southeast Asia more than 5,000 years ago, when the Austronesians began an eastward thrust into the Pacific. 

From Indonesia they headed East, reaching Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and finally Fiji. Dispersed throughout the earth's largest and loneliest expanse of water, their exploits remained unknown to the rest of the world until recently. They were the first blue water sailors.

It says the proportion of the population with a BMI of over 24, which indicates a person is overweight, reached 47%, a record high. Let''s hear what a Taipei doctor had to say about this. 

Kang Jung-cheng
Taiwan Adventist Hospital
We know that with obesity, the first thing that causes it is eating more while exercising less. The current environment and the ease of living also play a role. Previously, people probably needed to walk long distances to go to class. Now there are the MRT and buses, so the first thing is that people’s physical activities have been reduced. Secondly, the consumption of sugary drinks is excessive. 

The doctor stressed that in addition to genetic factors, the causes of obesity are mainly related to diet, the amount of exercise a person gets, and overall lifestyle. Aside from having a balanced diet, more exercise is needed to combat obesity so as to avoid reduced immunity, which may lead to disease.","Almost one in two Taiwanese are overweight or obese: Health Promotion Administration"

anthocyanin and several important vitamins. Our ancient healing text says,
black rice helps to prevent cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
This is very good for your kidney, stomach and liver. Another beauty of this is. Due to high fibre content, consuming just 1/3rd the quantity is more than enough for the day and you will not feel hunger.
Can be used to make Idli,payasam, dosa,etc..
American Chemical Society (ACS) says, one spoonful of black rice contains more anthocyanin antioxidants than a spoonful of blueberries.

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

People featured in this film: Marion Nestle, Marlene Schwartz, John Bode, Nelson Eusebio, J. Justin Wilson, Dr. Olajide Williams, Lauren Von Der Pool, Julie Paradis, Cathal Armstrong, Ed Bruske,

OBESITY RATE

A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. 

In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.","WORLD OBESITY RANKINGS 2019"

Transcript:
One of the most universally recognized images 
of the South Pacific is the coconut palm.
It's an excellent colonizer, capable of surviving
 long periods of time floating along until chance 
might have it bump into a patch of warm soil on which to root.
 
The coconut is an indispensable ingredient
 in Polynesian life.       
Its milk provides a nourishing beverage.
It is also dried into Copra for use in cooking oil and body oil.
The coconuts are even used by children as flotation devices!
But, most of all, it is the basis for almost every traditional dish in the 
Polynesian diet.
Basic staple dishes include a concoction of Taro leaf, 
which is much like spinach when cooked,  
 onion and corned beef.  
This is wrapped in a banana leaf  
and the coconut milk is added last.  
for dessert the mixture might be papaya slices and coconut milk.
  After wrapping, the bundles are placed in the 
pre-heated Umu or underground oven along with Taro root or yams.
All families have Umus  and they're used daily.
When it is full the Umu is covered with  banana leaves and old mats
to keep in the heat.
Several hours later the bundles are removed from the Umu and  
opened to reveal succulent, savory dishes.  
For special occasions, a very large umu may be used to bake 
an entire feast.   The key to a successful umu is a tight seal 
which allows the food to be simultaneously steamed, smoked, 
 baked, and bar-b-qued.
The traditional serving plate --     
a slice from a banana tree trunk--
is as recyclable as the pot that cooked the dishes.
 And, of course, the fingers can always be used again!","Traditional Tongan cooking and food: coconuts and the Umu"

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.
Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.
The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

Samoa Air began this policy in November and it has once again caught attention following a Norwegian report that suggested obese passengers should be charged more.

One passenger said: ""I don't think it's really fair because the skinny people will be paying less and the bigger people will be paying a whole more and I've got a bit of weight."" 


But Chris Langton the Samoa Air CEO disagreed with this saying:

""Once people have acknowledged that the aeroplane runs by weight and not by seats it makes it a lot easier for them to understand and recognise that its actually the fairest possible system of air carriage that's available.""

It is hardly surprising that the first airline to use this policy came from Samoa, according to a 2008 World Health Organisation (WHO) study almost 60 percent of its population is considered obese.

The Somali group, al-Shabab, says it has lifted a ban on aid agencies operating in the parts of the country it controls. 

Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, an al-Shabab spokesperson said, ""We have now decided to welcome all Muslim and non-Muslim aid agencies to assist the drought-stricken Somalis in our areas...""

In some areas, one out of every three children is malnourished, in one of the region's worst droughts in 60 years. 

The UN says close to three million people in Somalia need emergency aid.

Al-Shabab, which is said to be connected to al-Qaida networks in Africa and the Gulf, controls the majority of Somalia, including almost half of the capital, Mogadishu.

In the past, they have said food aid creates dependency, but they have also used aid for themselves and charged foreign organisations high fees to operate.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 📝 RÉSUMÉ ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

La testostérone est l'hormone androgène par excellence.

Chez l'homme, elle est en effet impliquée à la fois dans la prise de masse musculaire, la perte de masse grasse, la santé osseuse, l'humeur et la libido.

Des études démontrent à cette enseigne que les hommes qui ont des taux de testostérone naturellement élevés possèdent, en moyenne, une masse musculaire et une libido supérieures, de même qu'une masse grasse moins importante, que les autres.

Par conséquent, si vous souhaitez optimiser votre composition corporelle et booster votre santé, il est important de tout faire pour la maximiser.

Dans cette vidéo, je vous présente les quatre principaux facteurs hygiéno-diététiques à mettre-en-œuvre si vous voulez donner un coup de fouet naturel à votre production endogène de testo.

Voici le déroulé de la vidéo :

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or kidney damage. 
Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs from a combination of diet, other health problems, and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly eat meat or seafood, drink beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack
Cause
The crystallization of uric acid, often related to relatively high levels in the blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid.[4] Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes
Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout, and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, fructose-sweetened drinks, meat, and seafood. Among foods richest in purines yielding high amounts of uric acid are dried anchovies, shrimp, organ meat, dried mushrooms, seaweed, and beer yeast. Chicken and potatoes also appear related. Other triggers include physical trauma and surgery. 
Studies in the early 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, moderate consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits.
Treatment:
The eating or drinking of coffee, vitamin C, and dairy products, as well as physical fitness, appear to decrease the risk. Vitamin C supplements do not appear to have a significant effect in people who already have established gout.[4] Peanuts, brown bread, and fruit also appear protective. This is believed to be partly due to their effect in reducing insulin resistance

After this unique event Lifuka was chosen as part of a regional effort to understand how vulnerable Pacific Island communities can adapt to the impacts of rising sea levels.

The Australian-funded Pacific Adaptation Strategy Assistance Program enabled scientists to work closely with the Lifuka community to determine three main adaptation options: planned migration inland; sand replenishment and; the construction of an engineered revetment or seawall. 

This film, which follows on from the first documentary 'Rising Oceans: Changing Lives', examines Lifuka's struggle to make the tough choices needed to adapt to the changing coastline of a future Pacific.","Lifuka Island - The Coastline of a Future Pacific"

It averages the data from both sexes, ages 18 and up, and classifies obesity as having a BMI (body max index) of 30 or more.

BMI calculates a person's mass (weight) divided by the square of their height. An individual with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or more is considered overweight. An individual with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more is considered obese.

Top 10 most obese countries in the world:

Obesity is the scourge of overfed high income countries, right? THINK AGAIN! We weigh up the escalating global epidemic of obesity. In countries where hunger was once the killer, hundreds of millions of people could now be eating themselves to death.

In this global production, we travel to China where the consumption of sugar and oil has sent the national scales spinning; to Brazil where global food companies have fundamentally altered traditional diets; to India where it's predicted 100 million people will soon be suffering diabetes and on to Mexico, where the weight problem is so pressing, stomach reduction surgery is offered for free. The diagnosis is stark: ""No country has managed the transition to get rid of hunger without it shifting to obesity"" says anti-obesity crusader Barry Popkin. 

On the outskirts of Mexico City, the Bravo family is celebrating a birthday. Eating is a way of life here and the bigger the occasion, the bigger the portions. Juan Luis' father died from obesity at 42, and it made him take stock of his own size 56 trousers. Juan Luis has already undergone surgery to reduce the size of his stomach but three years on, unable to control his eating habits, he's packing nappies to go back to hospital. ""The thing I fear most is to die on the operating table, or to fail again"".

Mexicans are getting fatter faster than any other nation, largely due to their addiction to soft drinks. They drink a queasy ½ litre per person per day. Women in colourful cloaks hand out free Cokes to children at a mother's day parade in Chiapas. ""Babies have Coca Cola in their bottles instead of a formula"" explains Dr Abelardo Avila. ""Most of the adult population were malnourished as children and is programmed for food scarcity. When the body enters into a time of food abundance, especially sugar and saturated fat, the damage to the metabolism is brutal"". Diabetes is now the primary cause of death in Mexico.

""The Biggest Loser"" is a live-in weight loss camp in Shenzhen, China. Teenager Pan Jingyi is here because ""people laugh"" when she buys clothes. More than 380 million people in China are overweight or obese. The average Chinese consumes 400 calories of vegetable oil a day. There's also so much sugar consumed in China today, explains Barry Popkin, ""they have a sugar reserve along with the pork reserve. The government is so worried that sugar prices will go up, it will cause political unrest.""

Food companies, it seems, are operating in a moral vacuum: ""There are certain types of foods, 'food products' that are as bad as tobacco and alcohol"" says Brazil's Professor Carlos Monteiro. Here companies like Nestle market their calorific products aggressively, sending out door to door vendors like Vanderlea Rodrigues. ""I know that chocolate is a good source of energy"" she gushes. Nestle even has a boat that ferries snacks into the villages of Amazonia. 

But it's in India that we make the most shocking discovery: junk food products are altering not just the waistlines of young and old but even the genetic make-up of future generations. Dr Ranjan Yajnik runs a Diabetes Unit in Pune. He has found that babies are being programmed for diabetes and heart disease even while they're still in the womb, due to the mother's diet. ""That tells the genes how to behave, and that remains with the baby for the rest of life."" 

In a world where we are bombarded with messages to eat more hundreds of times a day, it's clear that obesity is a ticking time bomb.

Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia).Type 1 diabetes
The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.

Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.

Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.

Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according to SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease 
Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.

Diabetes patient measuring glucose level in bloodMeasuring the glucose level in blood
Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.

Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

Being overweight, physically inactive and eating the wrong foods all contribute to our risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Drinking just one can of (non-diet) soda per day can raise our risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 22%, researchers from Imperial College London reported in the journal Diabetologia. The scientists believe that the impact of sugary soft drinks on diabetes risk may be a direct one, rather than simply an influence on body weight.

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.

Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance. (Link to article)

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 2 diabetes page.

Six out of every 10 Tongans are obese. On average, Tongans' eat four times the amount of food recommended by the country's health department.

Tonga is now looking to ban or tax poor quality imported foods.

This is a list of countries ranked by the proportion of the population that is obese. The adult prevalence rate for obesity is defined as ""the percent of a country's population considered to be obese"". This obesity rate takes into account all adults with a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or above.

The top ten countries with the highest obesity rate: Micronesia, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Niue, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Palau, Cook Islands, Nauru.

The higher the BMI, the greater the risk of developing additional health problems. A healthy weight is considered to be a BMI of 24 or less. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 and above is considered obese.

I was approached by Lt Col Hon Ve'ehala while working on this clip. I didn't know he was watching me work on this piece. He asked to see the video and he loved it. His words were as follows: ""I hope this video attracts more tourists and inspires more Tongans living overseas to come back and build Ha'apai up.""

I just want to make note that this is just a family vlog & not a legit video but to have a noble commenting on my art is overwhelming & humbling.

I would like to thank our parents Lupe and Fia for bringing us here to beautiful Ha'apai. Thanks to Noia Fotu-Moala Leio Fotu-Moala and Ofa for helping me film this clip. And my wife Noa Ng Lam for all love and support.

If you're Tongan and living overseas please share this clip. Yes I'm Samoan and I'm not from here but I love it here in Ha'apai & too wish that those who can help from overseas, help build this beautiful island up.

There are more vids coming. We shot tonnes of footage, probably shot 500GB worth of vids and photos. We'll post it up when we have good wifi.

The airline said it won't weigh customers in at check-in; passengers will just enter their weight details when booking online.

Nearly 80 percent of Samoa's adult population is obese and the airline said it hoped that its new policy will have the added benefit of encouraging healthier habits among the local population.

Orthopedic Surgeon S. Muthukumar from Parvathy Hospital talks about the common factors which causes neck, back and joint pain. Back pain is a very simple and common problem. The reason for the back pain is that we have not 'respected' our back. Sedentary lifestyle where the habit of walking has reduced so much in our lives, its highly possible that everyone might get these pains at least ones in their lifetime.

The very first McDonald's restaurant appeared in Kuwait on a U.S. military base set up to support the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, the industry has rapidly expanded — there are now hundreds of U.S. fast food restaurants in Kuwait and as a result, the country has become one of the most obese nations on the planet. 

""The begining of fast food, I would say it is part of the Americanization of the culture here."" Dr. Mohsen Bagnied, a professor at the American University of Kuwait told VICE News. Now, Kuwait has roughly double the percentage of diabetic adults than the U.S. 

​The fast food industry isn't just operating in the Middle East. American Fast food brands populate more than 100 countries around the world, occupying six continents. And the global fast food industry is projected to be worth over $600 billion by 2019. 

VICE's Gianna Toboni travels to Kuwait to witness the health effects on a country deep in the throes of an unlikely obsession with U.S. fast food.

The most obese countries include the Cook Islands and Nauru in the top spots followed by developed countries like the United States and New Zealand. This world's most overweight countries list can be quiet surprising for you. 

The most obese countries in the world are not necessarily the richest or the most developed ones. The U.S. and the UK, which are ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, indicate there is no direct relationship between obesity and a country’s economic status. Countries with smaller economies, such as the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Palau, and Nauru have made it to the top 10.

The video shows the percentage of obese adults of the total population of the country.  The most obese continent is North America followed by Oceania, Europe, South America, Africa and Asia.

White sandy beaches and clear lagoons attract over 130,000 tourists a year, providing work for islanders and accounting for as much as 90% of the state’s economy. Land once used for agriculture is now being used for luxury resorts and holiday cottages. The islands used to export bananas and pineapples, but now the nation is 82% food import dependent, relying on weekly flights from New Zealand and cargo delivered by boat. Western style fast-food outlets have also arrived, where islanders spend their wages provided by the tourist industry. But as tourism has blossomed, so has obesity, such that in 2012, Ministry of Health research found a staggering 88% of men were overweight or obese.","Trouble in Paradise – Nutritional Challenges in the Cook Islands"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1vtpbzhTJ4","A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.

Hover over a country for details.
In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Pregnant women that are obese may suffer from complications that can lead to health problems for the mother or child. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.

Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their tradition cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:

Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)
Tonga (Average BMI: 31.9)
Samoa (Average BMI: 31.7)
Kuwait (Average BMI: 30)
Saint Kitts and Nevis (Average BMI: 29.7)
Saint Lucia (Average BMI: 29.6)
Kiribati (Average BMI: 29.6)
Palau (Average BMI: 29.4)
Micronesia (Average BMI: 29.4)
Tuvalu (Average BMI: 29.3)

We are Eteuati Ete and Tofiga Fepulea’i. Together we are the Laughing Samoans. The first show we ever did was a show called Laughing With Samoans back in February 2003. That show was such a success we abbreviated and adopted the name - the Laughing Samoans. Since then we've toured a new show every year, playing to packed houses throughout New Zealand, Australia, the Pacific and North America.

Obesity is one of the most common issues today, especially with the nature of life we’re living these days.

There’s much less room for natural food and remedies. And there’s too much “artificial”, “synthetic” and “fast food” stuff around us. This has enormously changed our eating habits, and even living habits.

An unwanted and unhealthy by product of this living style is “obesity” or being overweight.

There are various ways that people usually adopt to lose that unwanted weight. One of the most effective and most natural ways is juice detox.

Overweight and Obese are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Severely obese people die up to 10 years sooner than those of normal weight. By the numbers, 200 million men and 300 million women are obese, that's 10% of the adult population and the problem is still growing.

65% of the worlds population live in countries where they are more likely to die from obesity than malnutrition.

43 million children under 5 are overweight, that's almost 7%.

In Japan one-in-every-twenty adult women is obese compared to one-in-ten in Netherlands, one-in-four in Jordan and one-in-three in the United States and Mexico and up to seven-in-ten in Tonga.

The title ""Obese Nation:  Why are Americans So Fat"" was modified from a news story clipping.  It is not meant to offend anyone.  We have to use a title that will entice people to click.  If we said, ""The Real Way to Lose Weight,""  nobody would watch.  So no offense intended.  We also want to point out that Teri lost 50 pounds using the techniques in this video, and she has kept it off.  I myself lost 40 and never regained it.  We did this on our own using the information that we compiled over many years of research.

This video was designed to teach American consumers that there's a way out.  You do not have to be subjected to the tricks of the media, and the massive amounts of misinformation running rampant.  Not everybody is supportive of this effort, however.  

We welcome all comments and opposing opinions.  Most of the comments we've received have been overwhelmingly positive or add tremendous value.  But unfortunately, there have also been threats made, hate speech, racist rhetoric, and very severe abusive language.  After three years of constant trolling and abuse, we decided enough was enough, so we decided to disable the comments section.

Obesity has been a major health concern in Australia for over 20 years. Yet so far, no interventions have been successful in reducing population-level obesity anywhere in the world. Are we looking for answers in the right place? My work in Nauru, the UK and Australia suggests that culture has a key role to play. I outline three links between culture and obesity that I have observed in my work. If obesity is recast as a culture problem, what are the implications for policy making and governance?

About Dr Amy McLennan:
Amy is a Senior Analyst in the Project Office of the Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and a Research Associate at the School of Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Amy completed her MPhil and DPhil in Anthropology at the University of Oxford, where she investigated lifestyle change, sociocultural change and obesity emergence in one of the most obese nations in the world. She is an enthusiastic cross-disciplinary collaborator, having journeyed from the biomedical to social sciences in her university studies, and has co-published on topics ranging from anatomy to online food activism.

Amy is fluent in French and is getting there with German. She is passionate about food, and carries out regular experiments in the kitchen. She is also a rower, and represented the University of Oxford in the reserve boat ‘Osiris’ in the 2012 Boat Race.

For several months late 2017/early 2018 I served as one of the main programmers on an app called Our Special Island, as part of a larger project called Launch Legends. My responsibilities included the bulk of the code involving gameplay and interactions throughout the app, as well as the implementation of most art and audio assets.

Aimed at children in the first two years of school, Our Special Island aims to encourage positive attitudes among young children to eating fresh healthy food, as well as increasing children's awareness of foods available locally, on the land and in the sea. Our Special Island has been trialed at 11 schools in Tonga alongside a board game and other classroom resources. Every last detail was made with extreme care and cultural advice for it to truly feel Tongan.

Twelve months ago becoming a mother was merely a dream for thirty-two-year-old Samoan born Louisa. Now she is forced to make the difficult decision of trying to keep her baby and raise him in Samoa, or give him up to be raised with family in New Zealand.

This is exactly what scientists at Oxford University plan to do – to find new methods so people can make healthier food choices, control their weight and reduce their chances of heart diseases.

Public Health England reports that between 2012 and 2014 nearly 61% of adults were obese which means that the majority of the population is not only overweight but also susceptible to developing serious life-long maladies such as diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.

To get to the bottom of this issue, a set of three studies will be funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration and the scientists will theme their researches around behavioral issues regarding diet and obesity through low calorie foods, self-monitoring and awareness of food low in saturated fats.

UK has been termed “the fat man of Europe” because it contains the highest number of obese people in Western Europe. According to a report by National Health Services (NHS), in 2014, 58% of women and 65% of men were obese and consequently, 60% of bariatric surgery patients were aged 35 to 54. One of the major factors of obesity is an abstinence from physical activity.

However, those resources  exhausted. The island's economy had not diversified and no new resources had been sought. In the 90's, corruption and government mismanagement produced a great economic crisis due to the debts that the country had contracted.

But there were still many bad decisions to be made and controversial decisions came in their diplomatic relations.

How do you live today in Nauru, the country without capital? Why does it have the highest obesity rate in the world?

Former gang members, they often struggle to reconnect with the culture, the language, and the people. They are haunted by the stigma of their criminal pasts, which casts a pall over their employment prospects and puts a barrier between them and their compatriots. Government support for returnees is non-existent, wages are low, and with Tonga in the midst of a methamphetamine crisis, the temptations to revert to the lives of crime they hoped to leave behind when they left prison are high.

In the developed world, virtually everybody now has easy access to cheap, high-calorie fast food and ready meals. Keeping the pounds off requires more time, effort and money than most people can afford. Especially if you live in a 'food desert', where fast food is plentiful but the elements of a healthy, balanced diet are difficult to find.

As a result, the average Body Mass Index (BMI) has shot up across the developed world (and beyond). BMI is a measure of body fat based on an adult's height and weight (here's how to calculate yours).

If your BMI is under 18.5, you're commonly accepted as being underweight. The 'normal' weight range is from 18.5 to 25. You're overweight from 25 to 30, and obese if you're over 30. Obesity is a medical condition. It means you've accumulated enough body fat for it to negatively impact your health. If you're obese, you have a higher risk of getting diabetes, osteoarthritis and certain types of cancer and/or cardiovascular diseases.

Even though obesity affects a rapidly growing number of people, the share of people with a BMI greater than 30 shows a remarkable variation across national and state borders. This map of BMIs in Europe shows Turkey as the outlier in Europe, not just geographically but also with reference to BMI. The country on the southeastern edge of Europe has the highest score, with nearly one in three Turks (32.10%) being obese.

Number two at a fair distance, but way ahead of its immediate neighbors, is the UK, with well over a quarter of the adult population being clinically overweight. The rest of the top five, all at or just above 26%, are all in Eastern Europe: Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic (in that order).

If, as indicated above, higher levels of obesity could be linked to higher levels of poverty, can national BMI levels be interpreted as an indication of a country's overall wealth? As this map indicates: probably not—at least not in isolation.

También participarán los doctores Muhammad Ali Pate, director de Salud, Nutrición y Población en el Banco Mundial y Barry Popkin, profesor de la Universidad de Carolina del Norte.

""Muchos países de bajos y medianos ingresos enfrentan una doble carga: una alta prevalencia de desnutrición y obesidad. A medida que aumenta el ingreso per cápita, la carga de la obesidad se traslada a los pobres y a las zonas rurales. Para evitar el aumento de la obesidad en las generaciones futuras, los gobiernos y los socios de desarrollo deben adoptar un enfoque integral, que incluya un fuerte enfoque en las medidas preventivas"".
