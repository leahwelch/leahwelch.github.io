Thirty-five percent of adult Americans are currently termed obese and medical experts have forecast this figure will rise to a staggering 50 percent by the year 2030. 
 
Since becoming First Lady,  Michelle Obama has made fighting the fat one of her causes.
Yesterday she hosted a "" Kids Dinner"" at the White House promoting healthy eating among children in which her husband made an unscheduled appearance. 

 ""Keep it up,"" said the president. ""You guys are going to set a good example for everybody all across the country because you are eating healthy and you are  out there, active and playing sports and you are in the playground and doing all those things.""

Medical  costs  for treating obesity-related diseases are expected to rise  by $48 billion (37 billion euros) to $66 billion (51 billion euros) per year if the obesity rate continues  at the current pace.

Nutritionists and medical experts such as Dr. Andrea Hulse-Johnson from Montgomery Family Medicine Associates say the way forward is to educate children and stop them adopting the bad eating habits of their parents.
 
""The risks of childhood obesity, if we do not address them as a nation, are an increased risk for the chronic conditions including diabetes, including hypertension and heart disease. These are the big ones in our country,"" said Dr. Hulse-Johnson.

She added: ""I do believe that these chronic conditions starting earlier in life set a person up for not only long-term use of medications and the need to manage them medically, but a shortened lifespan.""

Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health.People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 kg/m2, with the range 25–30 kg/m2 defined as overweight.Some East Asian countries use lower values.Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and depression

Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility.[1][4] A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder.[9] The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.

According to the camp commandant the number of overweight children in Beijing has increased threefold in 15 years. Keeping China’s youth slim is now serious business: kids' fitness here means the difference between a good school and a lousy school. For the children who fail the test, it means disappointment and humiliation for the family. Sitting at the top of a mountain after a vigorous camp hike, the camp's inmates are smug. “I think my belly is flatter than before…I feel excellent!” His classmate though has mysteriously disappeared. 15 year old Ou Yang did not make it: “I felt tired so I er…went down.”

Welcome to Displore and thanks for watching. In this video we will be bringing you the top 10 African countries with the most obese population.A person is obese when their Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.The number of obese people in the world  is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.Research shows that obesity increases an individual's risk of developing many diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and several types of cancer. While obesity rates have historically been relatively low in Africa, they are steadily rising throughout the continent. Higher rates of obesity in Africa are attributed to increased urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, and fat-rich diets. The Whole Health Organization carried out a research to determine which countries in Africa are the most obese. The most obese countries were considered depending on the percentage of the total population that is obese. The higher the percentage, the more obese is the country’s population.

Being overweight at age 10 is ridiculous and being able to say that out loud shouldn't be considered ""body shaming"".  My goal has and always will be to help teach fitness to the world.  But every video can't just be a new workout idea or exercise for bigger biceps.  Hard truths hit home and I hope that if you are reading this and are overweight that you know there is always a chance to change and I can help you get there.

This article is going to hit home with some hard truths that will either make you upset, or help you decide to finally take the steps needed to make positive changes in your life. You don’t have to be a nutritional expert or a doctor to realize that more and more Americans are becoming obese. You can literally go to your local mall, walk around, and see it. In fact, believe it or not, one third of Americans, or 110 million, are classified as obese, and that’s not even taking into account those who are simply overweight, and hovering between healthy and obese.

But how come when we travel to places like Europe, the obesity epedemic we face seems non-existent? Sure, Europeans have been watching their waistlines grow bigger, but not at the same rate as Americans. In fact, only 1 in 6 Europeans is considered obese. That’s only about 17% of the population, which means that they are only HALF as FAT as we are. But why? Is there a secret we don't know about? Well, there are 5 VERY good reasons, which we're going to go over now!

Reason #1 – We Do NOT Eat Many Vegetables…If Any!
The first and possibly most important reason why Americans are fatter than our fellow Europeans simply lies in our nutrition choices. Most of our meals contain little to no vegetables and fruits and those that do, usually include some kind of potatoes or tomatoes. No dark leafy greens, no broccoli, no lettuce, no cucumbers and worst of all, very limited beans and nuts. Especially with so many people allergic to nuts these days – what's up with that? All these foods are known to be calorie-thin, yet extremely filling, because they contain FIBER.

Fibers make you fill satiated for longer, therefore reducing the appearances of cravings and binge eating.  But it goes far deeper than that. Fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts actually contain a tremendous amount of vitamins and minerals which our bodies NEED in order to lose weight, and help with absorption of our macronutrients.

Think about it like this; if your body is sick from the inside, missing micro-nutrients and fighting with chronic diseases, it will NOT prioritize weight loss, and a multivitamin is certainly not the solution. It doesn't matter if you're in a calorie deficit, and I don't care if you're exercising daily. Your fat loss will still be impeded by your poor nutrition and lifestyle choices. But the worst news here is that all of this information only accounts to our HOME meals alone, which brings us to our second reason.

Reason #2 – We Eat Out A Lot!
Over the last couple of years I visited both the United Kingdom, France and Greece, and while I definitely noticed a few fast food joints and restaurants, it was NOTHING like what’s happening here in the States, and the fast foods shops there are much healthier, in my opinion. If you see the golden arches in America, you know that Wendy's, Burger, Arby's and Panda Express are lurking somewhere close by. The fact of the matter is we are cooking less and less and eating away from home more and more. But why? Maybe because it’s more convenient, maybe because it’s less time-consuming or maybe because we don’t know any better. Due to inflation and high divorce rates, a lot of parents just don't have time to cook, so lots of kids grow up under the impression that daily fast food is OK. It’s definitely not because it’s less pricey though. Cooking and making your own home-made meals will always be much cheaper, but more than half of our food dollars are now being spent on restaurants and convenient on-the-go meals.

The fattest place on earth isn't in America.

The tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru holds that honor. At only 8.1 sq. miles, with a population of less than 10,000, the country's inhabitants have virtually become giants.

Ninety-five percent of the island's adult population is overweight, and 85 percent of the male adult population is obese, according to ABC News.

However, island natives haven't always been this fat. According to ABC, it wasn't until they began importing Western food that the population's size exploded. Now half of Nauruans suffer from Type II diabetes.","The Fattest Place on Earth"

Are food documentaries to blame for the obesity crisis in America?  Not technically however, is it fair to say that they do feed the frenzy and FAD-TRENDING arena of all things DIET?  Maybe ...

There is NO shortage of diets out there and to be honest whatever you are eating right now is your diet; even if it lacks a specific name.  

Food documentaries certainly have their place as far as providing information and keeping us up to date with current and trending issues.  But is it always accurate and presented WITHOUT BIAS?

In this video Coach Tonya shares with you what she likes and does not like about food documentaries, as well as some tips on how to make sense of research studies to find out answers for yourself 😊

So say health experts in the United Arab Emirates - where two thirds of men and almost three-quarters of women are overweight.
Expatriates are also piling on the pounds - and turning to a range of solutions in the battle against the bulge.
STORYLINE:
As one of the most cosmopolitan countries in the world, the UAE caters for all nationalities and tastes.
And that includes fast food.
Whether you want burgers and chips or pizza and wings, you don't have to walk far to find it in the Gulf state.
Chances are you won't be walking far at all, though - staggeringly high temperatures for much of the year mean that most people rarely walk outside.  
In the UAE the car is king - depriving Emiratis and expats alike of the rare opportunity for exercise.
Little surprise, then, that obesity rates are rocketing.
According to the World Health Organisation, some 67 percent of Emirati men and 72 percent of Emirati women are overweight.  
Almost 40 percent of women in the UAE are clinically obese - the seventh highest proportion in the world.
More than a quarter of men are obese - the ninth highest.
That has led to a rise in weight-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, with which experts say 22 percent of the population has been diagnosed.
Children are affected, too.
Almost a third are overweight or obese - and children as young as eight are being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes and hypertension.
There are no figures for the expat population, who make up about 80 percent of the population, but experts say they are also following the trend.
Many of those expats are now turning to weight-loss experts to beat the bulge.
Take Aakriti Mago, who sought out nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary.
She subsequently dropped her dress size from 16 to 12 - and is now aiming for size 10.
And it's clear to Mago what's to blame for all the expanding waistlines.
""I think it's the ease of getting fast food all around you,"" she says. ""So Even if you are driving every 10 seconds or so you'll see a McDonald's, KFC, you've got these little cafeterias that sell shawarmas (kebabs) and fried nuggets and unhealthy stuff.""
""I think it's just that, especially with the lifestyle that we have here, if we are working late it's so easily available,"" she adds.
Chowdhary, who runs a nutrition and weight-loss centre in Dubai, says the number of expats using her service has doubled in the past year.
And once people gain weight, she says, they often search for quick fixes such as diets, pills and appetite suppressants.
Chowdhary blames both the sedentary lifestyle in the UAE and its affluence for the alarming rise in obesity.
But she also worries about the perception that people there have about health, weight loss and fitness.
""Most people want guarantees,"" she explains. ""You know, 'I want to lose five kgs (kilograms, about 11 pounds) in five weeks or five years'."" 
""So what happens with this kind of thinking is that you might lose those kgs but you don't realise that when you lose it too fast it's probably just muscle and water, and what happens then (is) it always comes back,"" Chowdhary says.
She maintains that people who want to lose weight need to make basic lifestyle changes - such as eating healthy food and doing more exercise.
Among those treading the right path is Chris Dcosta, an Indian-Canadian national.
He moved to the UAE nine years ago and has since put on 50 kilos (110 pounds).
Chris now weighs 148 kilos (326 pounds) - and points the finger of blame at his long working hours.
And that isn't Chris's only motivation to lose weight.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWNx7-LmyDA","(28 May 2019) The number of new diabetes cases among U.S. adults keeps falling, even as obesity rates climb.
New federal data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the number of new diabetes diagnoses fell to about 1.3 million in 2017, down from 1.7 million in 2009.
Earlier research had spotted a decline, and the new report shows it's been going on for close to a decade. But health officials are not celebrating. 
Associated Press Medical Writer Mike Stobbe says that while the numbers are dropping, experts are puzzled as to why. 
Among the possibilities: Changes in testing and getting people to improve their health before becoming diabetic.
The report was published by the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research &amp; Care. The statistics run through 2017. Last year's numbers are not yet available, Benoit said.
Diabetes is a disease in which sugar builds up in the blood. The most common form is tied to obesity, and the number of diabetics ballooned as U.S. obesity rates increased.
The American Diabetes Association recommended the new test, known as the hemoglobin A1C blood test, for routine screening in 2010. Because it's easier to do, it would be expected to lead to more diagnoses. 
But some experts say it may miss a large proportion of early cases in which people aren't showing symptoms. That means the new health tests may be missing people that would have been diagnosed with the older tests. 
The decrease was mainly seen among white adults, the researchers said.
Meanwhile, the overall estimate of how many Americans have diabetes — whether the diagnosis is recent or not — has been holding steady at 80 per 1,000 U.S. adults. That translates to about 21 million Americans.
Diabetes has continued to become more common among young adults and people who are black and Hispanic, the report noted.

The latest World Health Organization data indicates that 1.9 billion people worldwide are overweight, with 600 million considered obese. Sugar, in the form of processed, high-in-sugar foods are largely to blame.

Scientists around the world are making a desperate plea to stop an epidemic of obesity. But now, new research goes beyond fat to reveal a risk that could be even greater.

TechKnow explores the science of sugar at the Department of Molecular Bioscience School at the University of California-Davis where cutting-edge research is being done. The project, headed by Dr Kimber Stanhope, put healthy young adults in their 20s on a highly controlled sugary diet for 10 weeks and then measured the effects of that added sugar.

TechKnow explores the correlation between sugar intake and heart disease in young adults.

The obesity epidemic has spread to the Third World and it is likely 1 billion people will be obese by 2030. So how did it explode in places that, not so long ago, counted malnutrition and even famine as major concerns? Well it's mostly about the aggressive marketing and low prices of Western fast food. As globalisation and a little more money open up Third World markets, the first to step in are the likes of McDonalds and Coke. In this global production, we travel to China where the consumption of sugar and oil has sent the national scales spinning; to Brazil where global food companies have fundamentally altered traditional diets; to India where it's predicted 100 million people will soon be suffering diabetes and on to Mexico, where the weight problem is so pressing, stomach reduction surgery is offered for free. The diagnosis is stark: ""No country has managed the transition to get rid of hunger without it shifting to obesity"" says anti-obesity crusader Barry Popkin. In a world where we are bombarded with messages to eat more hundreds of times a day, it's clear that obesity is a ticking time bomb.","Globesity: Fat's New Frontier"

According to new WHO statistics on obesity in Asia, Taiwan ranks in the top 5 nations for childhood obesity. Weight management experts say the culprits are sugary drinks and spending too much time playing with consumer electronics. Taiwanese children love fried food and sugary drinks, and that’s a big part of why more and more children are becoming obese. The latest World Health Organization report ranks childhood obesity in 11 Asian countries. Taiwan ranks fifth for boys and fourth for girls.Liu Yi-liNutritionistCurrently, one in four Taiwanese children is overweight or obese. The biggest problem is with theirdiet, it’s usually that they’re mostly drinking sugary drinks. They are very easily converted to triglycerides or body fat. But diet is not the only problem. Taiwanese kids’ love forstaring at screens is also a major factor. Experts say that obesity in childhood and adolescence should not be trivialized. Particularly if a child is still overweight in middle school, it can be very hard to slim down afterwards. Liu Yi-liNutritionistChildhood and puberty are both periods of growth and development, so new cells are constantly growing. If you are obese, you’ll get more and more fat cells, which means that when you become an adult, you will have more fat cells than other people. So then you may have a fat body type in adulthood.This nutritionist warns that we should pay more attention to what growing kids eat and drink, to make sure Taiwan doesn’t become the fattest nation in Asia.","Taiwan ranks in the top five for childhood obesity in Asia"

Obesity rates in America are disturbing.  Today obesity in America shows that 7 out of 10 Americans are overweight, heading towards obesity.  Stop for a moment and consider what that means. Because if this rate continues, and there’s no reason to believe it won’t, we will be faced with a health disaster beyond anything we’ve ever experienced before. It’ll be a nightmare scenario, because if we allow these figures to continue to grow, and there’s no reason they won’t, we’ll soon be faced with the probability that 10 out of 10 Americans will be Obese.

The implications of mass obesity are frightening.  We know obesity doesn’t stand still, it goes on to become Morbid Obesity. That’s a deadly disease that forces you to become bedridden because it makes body movements virtually impossible. Morbid Obesity will inevitably lead to death.  So will this be the future for 10 out of 10 Americans, by the middle of this century?  By today’s growing obesity rates in America, it is almost guaranteed. The reason nobody is offering a solution, other than futile diets and strenuous exercise is that nobody actually knows what has caused the obesity, when it began, and what we can all do about it. If we unravel the truth and expose what happened 50 years ago. Because this obesity epidemic was no accident.

It is not something we did to ourselves, it’s something that was done to us, 50 years ago, to enable a brutal industry to break our Basic Instinct, Intuitive Eating, to enable them to take over our everyday diet. They continue to do that, secretly and will keep doing it till they own our entire market of food.

You have only one chance to learn the truth. The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat will be revealed very soon. It’ll reveal not only the whole awful true story of what was done behind our backs 50 years ago. It’ll also show you, step by Step, Exactly What You Can Do to get back the slim healthy body nature meant you to have.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUspRBt7Kp4","Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal (2001) is a book by investigative journalist Eric Schlosser that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. More on the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/054...

First serialized by Rolling Stone in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to Upton Sinclair's classic muckraking novel The Jungle. The book was adapted into a film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater.

The book is divided into two sections, ""The American Way,"" which interrogates the beginnings of the Fast Food Nation within the context of post-World War II America; and ""Meat and Potatoes,"" which examines the specific mechanizations of the fast-food industry, including the chemical flavoring of the food, the production of cattle and chickens, the working conditions of beef industry, the dangers of eating meat, and the global context of fast food as an American cultural export.

Fast Food Nation opens with discussion of Carl N. Karcher and the McDonalds brothers, examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of Ray Kroc and Walt Disney's complicated relationship as well as each man's rise to fame. This chapter also considers the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits Colorado Springs, CO and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee: fast-food restaurants employ the highest rate of low-wage workers, have among the highest turnover rates, and pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of its employees than any other American industry.

The second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agriculture world in a new economy. Schlosser is perhaps most provocative when he critiques the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America. Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become exponentially more hazardous since the centralization of the industry: the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed provides an ideal setting for E coli to spread. Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War: the collapse of Soviet Communism has allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.

The book continues with an account of the evolution of fast food and how it has coincided with the advent of the automobile. Schlosser explains the transformation from countless independent restaurants to a few uniform franchises. ""The extraordinary growth of the fast food industry has been driven by fundamental changes in American society... During that period, women entered the workforce in record numbers, often motivated less by a feminist perspective than by a need to pay the bills. In 1975, about one-third of American mothers with young children worked outside the home; today almost two-thirds of such mothers are employed. As the sociologists Cameron Lynne Macdonald and Carmen Sirianni have noted, the entry of so many women into the workforce has greatly increased demand for the types of services that housewives traditionally perform: cooking, cleaning, and child care. A generation ago, three-quarters of the money used to buy food in the United States was spent to prepare meals at home. Today about half of the money used to buy food is spent at restaurants - mainly at fast food restaurants.""

Regarding the topic of child-targeted marketing, Schlosser explains how the McDonald's Corporation modeled its marketing tactics on The Walt Disney Company, which inspired the creation of advertising icons such as Ronald McDonald and his sidekicks. Marketing executives intended that this marketing shift would result not only in attracting children, but their parents and grandparents as well. More importantly, the tactic would instill brand loyalty that would persist through adulthood through nostalgic associations to McDonald's. Schlosser also discusses the tactic's ills: the exploitation of children's naïveté and trusting nature.

In marketing to children, Schlosser suggests, corporations have infiltrated schools through sponsorship and quid pro quo. He sees that reductions in corporate taxation have come at the expense of school funding, thereby presenting many corporations with the opportunity for sponsorship with those same schools.

It’s kind of how we screen people for obesity. It’s a measure of your weight divided by your height,” said Dr. Lee Coghill, a global health fellowship physician with Lee Health. 

Your body mass index, or BMI, measures the amount of fat tissue a patient has. A patient is considered overweight if they have a BMI over 30.  “We know that once you get to a certain weight, it becomes more and more difficult to lose the weight with just diet and exercise alone,” said Dr. Coghill. 

This is why doctors are having the conversation with their patients early, in hopes of preventing obesity and future health problems. “There are really strong studies that show an increase in heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and lots of different cancers with them,” said Dr. Coghill. 

Adding 20 minutes of daily exercise and subtracting high-calorie snacks can make a big difference to your weight and health. “Specifically, potato chips are one of the recognized number one things that cause increased weight gain in middle-aged men and women,” said Dr. Coghill.  

As patients age, a higher body weight means a higher risk of health problems. “Some of the modifiable risk factors are fast foods, sugary beverages, physical inactivity, child obesity, which we can combat,” said Dr. Coghill. 

Small changes to your diet and lifestyle can make big improvements to your health.

With billions of fans scheduled to tune into the upcoming 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hasan examines how the game has evolved from a sport of British colonizers into a tool of diplomacy and a force for good despite recent scandals and corruption. Hasan also explores how cricket has especially grown in India due in part to the creation of the IPL, a flashy professional cricket league founded by the infamous Lalit Modi, and how that expansion has unfortunately come at the expense of the growth of cricket in other countries.

She has already convinced Walmart to lower prices on fruit and vegetables and is in talks with the National Restaurant Association to downsize portions. But the real problem is corn subsidies, which make it cheaper to produce everything from beef to Coca Cola. Can Michelle Obama kill this sacred cow?
According to a recent study in The Lancet, the world is getting fatter and America is leading the way by exporting its bad eating habits to the rest of the world. Global obesity has doubled since 1980.

Dr. Elisabeth van Rossum has published more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications or books and received 20 awards for her scientific research. A clinical internist-endocrinologist, and a professor in the field of obesity and biological stress at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, she is also the head of Obesity Center CGG, an academic center for diagnosing underlying causes of obesity and for innovative treatment strategies of obesity. In her talk she exposes a surprising number of causes of obesity, as well as a number of simple steps to take to reduce the effects of those causes. The most important: reducing shame.

The American dinner plate is deficient in nutritious produce, and part of the problem is cost. Because diets low in fruits and vegetables have serious consequences, health advocates have tried to incentivizes Americans to choose apples over donuts for years but with little success.

In the US, a nation with high rates of diseases such as obesity and diabetes , a variety of strategies - from a junk food tax to a produce prescription program - are now being tested. But there are a number of factors that still stand in the way of Americans having healthier, more affordable produce and dietary options.

“The U.S. Army is struggling to find physically fit recruits and it's a threat to national security, according to a report from researchers at The Citadel, a military college in South Carolina, released Wednesday.

The researchers found the issue is particularly evident in 11 Southern states–––Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas––where recruits were found to be ""significantly less fit and/or more likely to become injured than recruits from other U.S. states."" 

The South has some of the highest obesity rates in the country. Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama all have adult obesity rates about 35 percent, placing them among the top 5 most obese states in the U.S. (West Virginia has the highest rate of adult obesity, at 37.7 percent), according to the State of Obesity, an annual report from non-profit Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.”

With 81 million expected to be overweight and 
113 million obese by year 2022. 
And yet obesity is a disease like any other and has to be dealt with accordingly. Now this is dangerous as this leads to diabetes, heart disease, leads to loads of cancer, stroke and joint problems all over the body.

This video highlights the difference between the food environment of America and Japan. America's obesity rate is about 30% (biggest state is 37.7%, smallest 22.3%) whereas Japan's obesity rate is 3.5%
While there's other countries on each side of the obesity spectrum, I chose to compare these two because I grew up in America and spent the last 7 years here in Japan. The places that I describe as ""reasonably healthy"" in Japan aren't necessarily places I recommend as ""optimally healthy"" - I'm simply point out that while convenient food in America ranges from very unhealthy to unhealthy, convenient food in Japan ranges from very unhealthy to pretty healthy.

Lustig, M.D., M.S.L. is Professor emeritus of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). He specialises in the field of neuroendocrinology, with an emphasis on the regulation of energy balance by the central nervous system. His research and clinical practice has focused on childhood obesity and diabetes. Dr. Lustig holds a Bachelor’s in Science from MIT, a Doctorate in Medicine from Cornell University. Medical College, and a Master’s of Studies in Law from U.C. Hastings College of the Law.

Dr. Lustig has fostered a global discussion of metabolic health and nutrition, exposing some of the leading myths that underlie the current pandemic of diet-related disease. He believes the food business, by pushing processed food loaded with sugar, has hacked our bodies and minds to pursue pleasure instead of happiness; fostering today’s epidemics of addiction and depression. Yet by focusing on real food, we can beat the odds against sugar, processed food, obesity, and disease.

A decade ago, both genders' obesity rates were roughly the same, at about 35 percent of Americans for each.

But a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association says while men's obesity rate stayed at 35 percent, by 2014, women's had climbed to 40 percent.

The earliest year researchers can report on is 2014 because they wanted government data that prevented people from lying about their health.

The increase in obesity for women, or even the lack of a decrease for men, could be troubling, considering how much money has been spent on campaigns against it.

A different JAMA article notes hundreds of millions of dollars have gone toward obesity research and drug development.

And the Harvard School of Public Health says in 2005 –– even when the women's rate was lower –– the U.S. spent $190 billion on health care expenses stemming from obesity.

One limit to the prevalence study we first mentioned could be what's counted as obese.

The government data used height and weight proportions to calculate participants' body mass indexes –– not their fat content directly.

Some experts say that obesity will not be tackled properly until it is seen as a disease but others say this could be dangerous.

According to the World Health Organisation, 30% of adults in the UK are obese and that number has tripled since 1980, making the UK the most obese country in western Europe.

Description:  Global diets are increasingly facing the dual challenge of undernourishment and obesity. UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier de Schutter, has released a new report calling for a reassessment of unhealthy food systems in both rich and poor countries. Both are increasingly characterized by an abundance of low nutrition, high calorie, processed foods. A recent study by Sarah Clark, Corinna Hawkes, Sophia Murphy, Karen Hansen-Kuhn and David Wallinga in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health  examines the role U.S. agriculture and trade policies play in contributing to the rise in obesity, with a spotlight on Mexico. See IATP's summary fact sheet on the article at iatp.org, or read the full article. Join us for this discussion about how our global food system is driving the rapid rise in diet-related disease, and what can be done about it.","Exporting Obesity?

If someone is diagnosed as being obese, it’s only natural for him or her to start looking for obesity help and treatments that will allow them to lose weight quickly.

Contrary to what some may believe, fat liposuction is not an effective solution for the treatment of obesity. Intended to be more of a body sculpting treatment, liposuction removes a minimal amount of fat, which is not enough to see a considerable weight loss difference.

The first place patients should look for obesity solutions is their diet and exercise regimen. There is no substitute for putting a self-care plan into place that includes eating healthy and working out.

Hey it’s Zeek Fit Freak Welcome to the best place to create the body and mind you LOVE!

Happy Monday, I’m testing out a few video settings today so I thought I’d share with you some really interesting, sad, and upsetting facts I learned this morning.

I was reading an article today on the Obesity Rates in the US by Pamela Kuf-ahl. The link to it is in the descripton below if you want to read it. 

Anyways, here’s some bullet points and facts I found interesting. 

Last Friday  the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released an annual report based on data from the 

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Mannnn that’s a mouth full 


The report said that nationally nearly 38 percent of adults are obese 
defined as those with BMIs of 30 or higher

while almost 8 percent of adults are extremely obese
 define as those with BMIs of 40 or higher

Nationally, 40.4 percent of women are obese while 35 percent of men are obese.

The four states in which obesity rates declined were:

* Minnesota at 26.1 percent
* Montana at 23.6 percent
* New York at 25 percent
* Ohio at 29.8 percent

Lets give it up now!
* 
The two states in which obesity rates increased were:
* Kansas at 34.2 percent
* Kentucky at 34.6 percent

Boo


No state has an obesity rate of less than 20 percent.

I thought this was cool, my third favorite state is coming out on top. 

 Colorado's obesity rate was the lowest at 20.2 percent. 

By comparison, 30 years ago in 1985, NO state had an adult obesity rate of more than 15 percent.

Now the next two findings I find incredibly interesting.
* 
The Differences exist based on education levels:
* People who did NOT graduate from high school had an obesity rate of almost 33 percent based on data from 2008-2010
* People who graduated from college or technical school had an obesity rate of 21.5 percent based on data from 2008-2010
* 
Then The Difference based on income levels were:
* 33 percent of adults who earn less than $15,000 per year are obese AND THEN
* 
* 24.6 percent of adults who earn at least $50,000 per year are obese 


Very interesting to say the least. I’m not going to make any specific conclusions of this data today but it’s something important to know and think about.

Now There is some recent policy changes the report mentioned would help improve the obesity rates.

The “Every Student Succeeds Act” which allows schools with a high percent of students from lower-income families to be eligible for federal funding for physical education classes. 

And

The U.S. Department of Agriculture not only updated the nutrition standards in its Child and Adult Care Food Program, 

But it also updated requirements in school wellness policies related to nutrition standards.

I think both of those sound awesome but it’s just the beginning of what we need to do as a country and society.

And I really pray that this youtube channel I am making will be a part of the  educating that clearly needs to take place n to help those in need. 

QOTD: What do you think could help make a difference in our states obesity rates?

A recent government study shows that obesity among young Korean students is on the rise.
Seoul's education ministry says 25 percent of young students in the country were obese last year.
The obesity rate has been increasing every year since 2014, when the figure was just over 21 percent. 
The overall health of school students is also deteriorating, mainly due to a lack of exercise and sleep, as well as an unhealthy diet.

Well, believe it or not, America doesn’t even break the top 10 countries on the obesity scale. It sits at 16th, between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. That’s right. There are at least fifteen countries with bigger waistlines than in the US.

Transcription of the video:

Hey, it's Adam Foote with ThinnerIn30, and today I want show you three exercises that can really help target your hips to help lose hip fat. All right, so the first one is going to be something simple, you can do at home. You're going to come down on all fours, and it's going be a side hip raise. 

So just like a dog peeing on a fire hydrant, if you picture that, all right? That's what you're going to do with your hip. So on all fours, take the hip straight out to the side. You're going to do 15 repetitions. Notice how my foot's not up here, back here, just bring the foot straight level. 

15 reps and you're really going to feel it in the glutes and hips, and you're going to do forward circles, so kind of like you are getting on a horse. So big forward circles, 15 that direction, 15 backwards, all right? So we're going to do that three step combo: side raise, forward circles, backwards circles, and then from right there, you're going to go into a bird dog. 

So opposite hand, opposite leg and you're going to go elbow to knee. All right you're going to really feel that right hip screaming. Ok, side, forward, backwards. Then were going to do something with the powerband, and I'll have a link where you can click these and get these for cheap on Amazon. 

But basically these are resistance bands you put around your knees and this is going to help target the glutes, and the hips as well. Alright. So put it around the knees. You're going to lay on your side, heel to heel. So feet together and you're just going to open your knees keeping the heels together and back down. And you're really target that hip, I mean, crazy isolation on that hip. OK? So, 15 of those. 

So the goal will be 15 repetitions of each exercise, three rounds through, all right? So 15 repetitions, three rounds through. See how your hips feel after that, I'll promise you'll be burning some hip fat with that.

This week's Global Pulse looks at the tactics being deployed worldwide by nations facing an epidemic of obesity. Looking to combat unwanted effects of our modern era's sedentary lifestyle, countries are harkening back to the salad days with campaigns encouraging exercise for adults and children, and the avoidance of fatty foods. As these broadcasters make clear, tackling the problem of childhood obesity requires parental involvement and better access to healthy food.

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University’s human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

We're told that if we are overweight, it's because we can't control ourselves. Personal responsibility has been cited as a cause of obesity over and over again. If that were true one third of America should be considered irresponsible. Deborah Cohen debunks this myth and provides the real causes of the obesity epidemic and how we can stop them.

Dr. Cohen is a physician and Senior Scientist at the RAND Corporation and is the Principal Investigator of several studies on the intersection of the built environment and health.  She is the author of the new book ""A Big Fat Crisis—the Hidden Forces Behind the Obesity Epidemic—and How We Can End It"" and the co-author of the book, ""Prescription for a Healthy Nation—a new approach to improving our health by fixing our everyday world"". She is the lead researcher on several studies investigating ways to change the environment to reduce the burden of chronic diseases. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","A big fat crisis -- stopping the real causes of the obesity epidemic | Deborah Cohen | TEDxUCRSalon"

It’s no secret that fast food is typically high in fat, sodium and sugar, and low in fruits, vegetables and fiber. But it’s convenient and often affordable. The downside, however, is more than just an unbalanced meal. Especially with long-term consumption, fast food can negatively affect you physically and emotionally.","Junk food Fat profits Obesity in America"

The title ""Obese Nation:  Why are Americans So Fat"" was modified from a news story clipping.  It is not meant to offend anyone.  We have to use a title that will entice people to click.  If we said, ""The Real Way to Lose Weight,""  nobody would watch.  So no offense intended.  We also want to point out that Teri lost 50 pounds using the techniques in this video, and she has kept it off.  I myself lost 40 and never regained it.  We did this on our own using the information that we compiled over many years of research.

This video was designed to teach American consumers that there's a way out.  You do not have to be subjected to the tricks of the media, and the massive amounts of misinformation running rampant.  Not everybody is supportive of this effort, however.  

We welcome all comments and opposing opinions.  Most of the comments we've received have been overwhelmingly positive or add tremendous value.  But unfortunately, there have also been threats made, hate speech, racist rhetoric, and very severe abusive language.  After three years of constant trolling and abuse, we decided enough was enough, so we decided to disable the comments section.

This webinar, presented by 2020 Australian of the Year Dr James Muecke, tells the story of Neil Hansell, a man who woke one morning blind in both eyes due to neglect of his diabetes. In this confronting 20-minute keynote presentation, Dr Muecke discusses why type 2 diabetes is a growing worldwide epidemic and explores a number of strategies to curb the toxic impact of sugar on our health and on our world.
 
About the presenter:
Australian of the Year 2020 Dr James Muecke AM has battled malaria, wild animals, rebel soldiers and insurgent groups, however this intrepid doctor’s most notable battle has been with the ravages of eye disease.
 
He founded Sight For All in 2008, turning his boundless energy into a fight against blindness in the Aboriginal and mainstream communities of Australia and some of the poorest countries of the world. His commitment to social impact and humanitarian endeavours has earned him a string of awards including an Order of Australia in 2012, the Australian Medical Association’s President’s Leadership Award in 2013 and Ernst & Young’s Social Entrepreneur for Australia in 2015.
 
In 2016, James unfortunately had to prematurely retire from surgery as a result of a progressive neurological disability. But nothing could defeat his passion to help others. James has been a researcher, a teacher, an author, a musician, a photographer and a film producer. He puts all those skills to use to deliver passionate, fascinating, and at times confronting presentations about his life, his work, philanthropy and social entrepreneurship.
 
James donates 40 hours of personal time weekly to Sight For All, and is intimately involved in projects in Ethiopia, nine Asian countries, and mainstream and Aboriginal communities of Australia. His leadership, determination and passion has improved eye health and helped alleviate poverty and disadvantage.

Read more about Body Mass Index's flaws on Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2nxeQ2U

The body mass index, better known as BMI, is a measure of obesity that has been in use for over 200 years. It was a formula created by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part it’s okay for those types of studies. However, when individual health is the topic at hand, using the body mass index can make judging a person’s health a little bit trickier.

Leigh A. Frame, PhD, MHS
Program Director, Integrative Medicine
Executive Director, Office of Integrative Medicine and Health

You mention…. That when comparing the U.S. diet to the diet of those who live in “blue zones” – areas with populations living to age 100 without chronic disease – the differences are stark.   What are the blue zones and what are the differences?

What foods are most associated with weight gain?
foods most associated with weight gain include potato chips, sugar sweetened beverages, sweets and desserts, refined grains, red meats, and processed meats, 
This causes... insufficient dietary fiber intake, a dramatic increase in food additives like emulsifiers and gums, and a higher prevalence of obesity, particularly in women.

So what is food most associated with weight loss?
lower weight gain or even weight loss is associated with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. 

So what are emulsifiers…. And what impact do they have on us?
emulsifiers, found in processed foods, have been found to alter microbiome compositions, 
elevate fasting blood glucose, 
cause hyperphagia, 
increase weight gain and adiposity, and 
induce hepatic steatosis. 
Recent human trials have linked ultra-processed foods to decreased satiety (fullness), increased meal eating rates (speed), worsening biochemical markers, including inflammation and cholesterol, and more weight gain. 
In contrast, populations with low meat, high fiber, and minimally processed foods — the “blue zones” — have far less chronic diseases, obesity rates, and live longer disease-free.

I really like this point…. Rather than solely treating the symptoms of obesity and related diseases with medication, we need to include efforts to use food as medicine,”.  Talk to me about this.

Chronic disease in later years is not predestined, but heavily influenced by lifestyle and diet.
How will we decrease obesity and chronic disease in the U.S?. 
will require limiting processed foods and
Increasing intake of whole vegetables, legumes, nuts, fruits, and water. 

Health care providers must also emphasize lifestyle medicine, moving beyond ‘a pill for an ill.’ Most are not trained!  What if you don’t have access to a plant based doctor?

Follow On Facebook: http://Facebook.com/HealthyWildAndFree

Kid's in America are more obese than any other country in the world because they are exposed to more television commercials for food than any other nation. One study found that kid's exposed to television commercials snacked 45% more than the group exposed to no advertising. 45% more food! That along with the lazy lifestyle of tv watching and video games do not add up to being healthy and fit. The main issue is advertising and giving kid's whatever kind of food they want which is usually rich in sugar, preservatives, gmo's and more junk! Your job is to help your child be healthy, and teach them ways to explore happiness for themselves. Ice cream or other short term fixes that you think make your child happy actually harm your child's health and teach them to be dependent on junk food and sugar for happiness, do you think that's a healthy habit to instill in them at a young age? 

Healthy Wild And Free is a blog, podcast and community focused on living healthier, greener lives.  The growth of the mind, body and spirit are some of the most enriching and rewarding experiences in life!

It may seem like a contradiction, but more adults in the U.S. say they are exercising at the same time more of them are becoming obese. About 24 percent of adults last year said they exercise enough each week to meet government recommendations for both muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise, according to a large annual health survey. That was up from 21 percent in 2015.

What is really causing the obesity epidemic?

Well, a lot of factors.

However, I think we can safely say that government low fat dietary guidelines are certainly not the sole cause.

In this video, Dr Raj explains what he means when shares that we’re facing a crisis and epidemic of obesity and overweight.

One billion people in the world are overweight. Nearly 70% of Americans are overweight.  For the first time in the history of our species our life expectancy is going down. That means that our children will get sicker and die younger than their parents. 

Dr Raj shares that anyone who is overweight has a higher risk of getting cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and many other diseases. We have 400,000 thousand people dying every year from obesity related causes and diseases. This makes obesity the single most preventable cause of death in this country. It has finally exceeded smoking.

He shares this is happening simply because we are eating the wrong foods, in the wrong combinations, and at the wrong patterns each day.

Most people accept the obesity epidemic and are aware that the obesity epidemic in America is beyond their control.  But is it really? ln the past 50 years, people in America have gone from being a nation of mostly slim healthy people to being a nation of mostly fat unhealthy people.  This was not something they did. The Obesity Epidemic is something that was done to them.

According to recent statistics, 7 out of 10 people are overweight, either heading for obesity or already obese.  If we take those numbers and bring them forward around 30 years, to say: 2050, it is more than reasonable to imagine that by the 10 out of 10 people will be obese.  Many will be morbidly obese, and a large percentage will be diagnosed with Diabetes Type2.  Both diseases are fatal. It doesn’t take a mathematician to figure out that most of the American population, is even now, on a fast train heading for oblivion. 

Yet the tragedy is that few if any of those people will know how they got there.  Why they’re obese and who caused it, because obesity is not something any sane person will want.  But it is something that has grown an industry from an average business, producing breakfast cereal, to a mega, worldwide industry prepared to take over or replace all our foods.

The key question is: What happened 50 years ago, to change us from slim healthy people to fat unhealthy people.  The reason is linked to one of our basic instincts, Intuitive Eating, that until 50 years ago, intuitively guided us to the foods our body understood and was able to process.  An industry was able to break that instinct and cut us loose from it, enabling them to introduce “foods” that Intuitive Eating did not recognize and our digestive system could process.

How this happened, how and why it stayed a secret till now and what you can do to turn back the clock and gain the slim healthy body to which you’re entitled, is told in “The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat”.  It will soon be launched by webinar. To attend the webinar make sure you download the free Report!

Worse, the city's weight problem has been passed down to its children. Rather than accepting the grim statistics, leaders of the town nicknamed ""Fat City"" began a campaign to combat their citizens' poor exercise and eating habits, as well as the poverty that often leads to obesity. But is it enough?

Nearly 70 percent of San Antonio residents are overweight or obese -- a figure that climbs to 80 percent in the poorest neighborhoods. Like much of the nation, the city is eating itself into an early grave. But the town's ""Fit City"" program promoting walking, fitness and eating healthy snacks offers some ope. The quest is: Will Fat City one day be able to call itself Fit City?

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3gchhScEkw","Childhood obesity is a serious problem. It’s one that is a growing concern for health experts who say most children are simply copying their parents eating habits. 

Dr. Denise Drago, a pediatrician with Lee Memorial Health System, says childhood obesity is on the rise. “The old statistics used to be one and 25 children was obese and now it’s about 1 and 4.”

Health experts say the problem typically doesn’t start with the child. “When the parents are obese, there’s a lot more likelihood that the kids will be obese too. The culture is raising more obese adults which are raising more obese children,” said Dr. Drago.

To determine if a child is overweight, doctors use a BMI chart to measure a child’s height and weight. “For adults they use the number value, for us we use percentiles. If you’re above the 85th percentile of your height compared to your weight for your age then you’re considered at risk for obesity. If you’re above the 95 percentile is when you become classified as obese,” said Dr. Drago. 

Obesity is a problem that can actually start at birth. Once a child is able to eat solid food, health experts recommend a diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, and protein. They also suggest prolonging the introduction of soda, juice, and sweets.

“We also talk about portion sizes and just how much should a child be eating. So when you look at what an adult would be eating, the amount you or I would have isn’t the same as they should,” said Dr. Drago. 

If a child doesn’t eat much during a meal, don’t over compensate later by giving high calorie snacks. 

“Kids are on iPads. They’re on iPhones. They’re doing a lot more things that keep them stationary. So that’s another concern,” said Dr. Drago. She says limiting the amount of time spent with technology and encouraging activity and healthy eating is important for both child and parent.

Childhood obesity is now linked to thyroid disease in children. “We started seeing more and more of these children who have elevated levels, and before we just assumed that they had an inherited predisposition and it turned out that’s it’s just related to obesity,” said Dr. Jehaimi. 

But for children, he says the problem is completely reversible with weight loss. “The thyroid that we see as being irregular in children who are obese, we tend to see that around 7, 8 and above,” said Dr. Jehaimi. 

The thyroid hormone is important for maintaining growth and development in children. It’s also important for thermoregulation and metabolism. “We try to preserve their endocrine system and maintain their thyroid function, maintain their insulin and glucose control,” said Dr. Jehaimi. 

The longer a child is obese, the more likely they will have metabolic changes or hormonal changes. “Unfortunately, we have seen many examples of children who don’t change their eating habits. They don’t change their lifestyle. Over time we see deterioration or changes in their labs and their hormonal profile,” said Dr. Jehaimi. 

Children are encouraged to have physical activity, like running, bicycling, swimming or playing a sport for at least one hour a day. “Almost 25 percent are obese in America,” said Dr. Jehaimi. 

Doctors say it’s important for parents to encourage healthy food options and exercise every day and limit things like sugar, fast food, and soda. Lifestyle changes that can improve a child’s health.

KETK spoke with a nutritionist from Trinity Mother Francis, Tami Lawrence, who said, ""Some of the southern states do seem to be hit a little bit harder with it. I think a lot of it is because we don't have to walk places we're going. Whereas in some of the metropolitan areas walking is how people get around"". By 2030 this could have major health repercussions, resulting in almost 3 million Texans with diabetes, and 6 million with heart disease.  

However, Texas is not alone. Heat and humidity are linked to obesity in most Southern states. Lawrence said, ""The South is known for a lot of fried food and rich foods. And a lot of gatherings are based around food, so I think it is more prevalent here in Texas"".  Especially during summer, when indoor air conditioning is more appealing than outdoor activities. Lawrence said, ""It does seem worse than what we see on a regular basis"". 

Even though personal trainer Brian Lacy says exercising outdoors is actually more effective. Lacy explained, ""When you work outside it's better, you burn more calories. and it's better for you to work outside than it is inside, in the elements"".  Just stay hydrated and exercise early in the morning or late at night, to avoid heat stroke. He reminds, ""Get out, get active, the main thing is getting active"".    

The number one most obese state is Mississippi.","Obesity Rates in Texas (Fox 51)"

Read my best selling book, The Stoic Body: https://amzn.to/36vdoUn

Sugar is always blamed for obesity and rightly so. In processed foods and in combination with fat it usually results in excess calories and cravings for more. 

However, we have a tendency as humans to always put the blame on one singular variable, in regards to the world’s obesity epidemic this variable is sugar. 

There’s no doubt sugar plays a role in obesity, but it is not the be all end all cause.

Yes calories in/out is the principle in effect here, yes a lack of sleep is also helping the cause, the cessation of smoking and certain medications, but if we take a wider look at our society, it becomes nonsensical to blame one thing and say sugar CAUSES obesity. 

Funny fact, in the USA sugar has been declining rapidly since 1999 (also other Western countries [UK, Canada, Australia etc…]) yet obesity continues to exponentially rise (60% of Americans are at risk for obesity) 

So what gives?…

There must be other factors involved. In this video I speak about ideas I am covering in my book The Stoic Body.

The first is that our sedentary lifestyle is clearly provoking greater risk for obesity.

Secondly, the hedonism we are falling into post world war II, similar to what happened to the Roman empire after they relaxed into a hedonistic lifestyle pre-Barbarian invasion (sugar could be included in this, but pleasure seeking isn't exclusive to one thing).

Furthermore how military conscription provided men with a “sense of urgency” to keep their physical selves in check.

Smartphone use has also been shown to reduce grey matter in the volume of the nucleus accumbens (responsible for reward, pleasure, satiation, etc…) I made a mistake in the video saying it was IN the hypothalamus, when it’s a region in the basal forebrain rostral to the pre optic area of the hypothalamus. 

I also briefly cover why I take a different approach to help people lose weight (focusing on mindfulness, reducing smartphone use, and focusing on creating a sense of urgency to change lifestyle habits, INSTEAD of simply saying - “Reduce your sugar consumption”.

There’s a lack of a philosophical approach to obesity and this is the gap I’m trying to compensate for.

There’s no doubt obesity in America is a massive, growing problem in America, as well as many other countries.  Obesity goes wherever the Food Industry goes.  It’s a harsh thing to say but all too true.  Take a moment to consider this: Until 50 years ago, it was normal to be slim and healthy. How do I know this? I’m 77 years old, I was there and I saw how obesity began. I watched as it grew into a food addiction and a constantly growing obesity epidemic. I also saw has this developed into Diabetes Type2, a dangerous disease that is also beginning to reach epidemic proportions.

But what this should tell us, is that it’s NOT NORMAL to be fat and it’s also not NORMAL TO DIET.  Knowing that it was once NORMAL to be slim should tell us that if we do the right thing for our body we will all be slim, just as nature intended.  Nature didn’t create weight problems, people did that, and they did it with the purpose for the sake of profits.  The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat, tells the whole story of how this happened when it began and who was and still is responsible. It will be launched soon, by a Webinar. 

You’ll want to be there with your family and friends to finally learn about how you were tricked into abandoning a natural way of eating that allowed you to choose your foods intuitively, using you Basic Instinct, Intuitive Eating.  A way to eat that kept us slim and healthy for centuries. That is how it was for everybody, till 50 ago, when an industry decided Intuitive eating had to go because it was preventing them from launching all those colorful, addictive processed foods, they intended to substitute with our natural foods.  They’re fast succeeding. 

So make sure you don’t miss this webinar. Download the free eBook, it will enable us to send you an invitation when a date has been set.

We spent some weeks in Europe recently. We were in Spain, Italy, and Sicily. We observed that we rarely saw obese natives. The people that we saw who were obese seemed to be mostly tourists from America and parts of north Central Europe.

We became curious about what people ate and how they lived and ate in ways that were different from what we see in America. These are the things we came to understand:

In Italy the locals that we saw in the villages and cities seemed to walk everywhere. The streets of many of the villages are cobblestone and steep. Walking seemed to be the primary means of transport during the day. They climb stairs whenever they have an opportunity and and they have many many opportunities in these villages.

For breakfast, locals told us they ate granita and brioche. Granita is a sugared ice drink or slush and the brioche is a very light bread that also has sweetness. They told us that around 10 or 11 they stop for a snack of cheese and meat or bread, and then between 1 and 3 they have lunch. This could be a pizza, pasta, a sandwich and/ or salad. Then around 7 or 8 in the evening, they have dinner with the family. They do not watch tv while they eat. They do not eat away from the table, and they eat and talk together.

The meals are mostly made from fresh ingredients, many of which they grow in their own gardens. If they don’t or can’t garden they go to the market many of them go marketing every day for fresh fruits and vegetables and they eat a lot of fish and very little beef. They eat goat and lamb and pork and chickens. Their salad dressing is made from vinegar (usually balsamic) and olive oil. Very lightly sprinkled over the salad.

Some of you may recognize this as what we call the Mediterranean diet. 

By comparison in America, we eat a lot of prepared foods, many are precooked and have lots of preservatives and sugars in them. Our government has a food policy that promotes the growth and sale of corn and corn sugar which is then put in most of our prepared foods. In America, we should learn to shop around the outside of the grocery store isles. Get the fresh ingredients and prepare fresh meals. Eat at home not in front of the tv but with the family. We need as a society to work on better portion control, especially when we go out to eat at a restaurant. We and they need to be better about portion size. One of the most horrific mistakes that parents can make raising their children is to make those children members of the clean your plate club!!","Obesity in America and Obesity in Europe"

The World Health Organisation considers adults with a BMI of 30 or more as obese. In this video, we will see the ranking of the most obese countries in the world by the share of adults that are obese from 1975 to 2016. this comparison shows some countries with a ridiculous obesity rate. The most obese country in the world wasn't America nor Kuwait but Nauru wich considered the top fattest country in the world basing on BMI index not only share of obese adults.

Economics shielded us from big sugar, as companies were forced to use it sparingly. The world changed the day we found a way to extract sugar from corn.  High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) was food's 9-11... suddenly sugar was dirt cheap. What was once saved for candy and cakes now started appearing in our breads, our salad dressings, and our cough syrups? The brakes were off - sugar was literally poured into absolutely everything. Heavily processed foods, laden with high fructose corn syrup were engineered in America, and then packaged up and shipped around the globe. Wherever this new food went, sickness followed.

After a long and welcome decline, Brazil's deforestation rates have begun to rise again, just as climate science shows how desperately we need the forest to survive. 

Now, backed by the country's powerful beef industry, the country's inflammatory new president Jair Bolsonaro has vowed to exploit Brazil's natural resources. Standing in his way: the determined indigenous peoples whose domain over the land are the last, best shot for the rainforest -- and possibly the world's climate.

The Americas can be seen as one of the world’s leading breadbaskets, in grains, coffee, livestock, produce and many other sectors. Yet food insecurity is present in all member states. Vulnerable populations are affected everywhere and it is more acute during natural hazards, health crises, chronic food waste or civil strife. But it is not solely an issue of national food availability and trade.

Millions of people remain undernourished, with large differences between countries and within the countries themselves. This is often due to impoverishment: economic access is a major factor deciding food insecurity. It is in most regions an income problem, though physical and cultural access also play a role.

How we feed ourselves also determines our well-being. Several regions suffer from multiple health issues from malnutrition to obesity. Food literacy is paramount as is the role of food labeling and dietary education. However, the whole system can easily be under threat from unexpected shocks like COVID-19 but also chronic long-term threats like climate change. This IICA dialogue series with universities across the Americas will debate these issues as they focus on the continent’s future food security, be it issues of food quality, safety, affordability, health, sustainability, resiliency, policy, technology, and acting climate smart.","Virtual Forum: Role of the Americas in Global Food Security"

“Look around you, and it’s not hard to see how serious the problem of obesity has become in America. People here are now bigger, and suffering from more obesity-related diseases, than ever before — prompting cities across the country to desperately try to fight back with measures like soda taxes and calorie labels.

Travel beyond the US borders, though, and you’ll see the same problem elsewhere: Obesity is now a growing phenomenon in just about every corner of the world, in poor and rich countries alike.

That’s the big take-home message from an impressive new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A global group of researchers, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, came out with the best estimate yet on the worldwide obesity burden, and found that more than 10 percent of the world's population — 107.7 million children and 603.7 adults — is now obese.”

Adult obesity levels are now higher in Mexico than the United States in official UN rankings, as the country battles to cope with changing lifestyles and diets.

A recent report by the United National Food and Agricultural Organisation found that almost a third of Mexicans - 32.8 per cent - were categorised as obese, compared to 31.8 per cent of Americans.  

More and more Mexicans are taking to guzzling fizzy drinks and downing junk food, turning their backs on the country's traditional fare of tortillas, beans and chilli. 

""The main cause of (the rise in obesity) is the deterioration of healthy habits. We are the country with the highest consumption of soft drinks in the world, 163 litres per person per year. Obviously, obesity is related to this but also to the abandonment of the traditional diet and the consumption of junk food,"" said Alejandro Calvillo, director of the consumer rights organisation El Poder del Consumidor. 

Weight-related diabetes is Mexico's biggest killer, reportedly claiming six times as many lives as the country's gang wars.

Obesity is now described as an epidemic, particularly hitting poorer communities, in tandem with malnutrition. 

""We have arrived at a point of no return. We either resolve it or we lose the country, the health system will collapse. The health system cannot collapse without the country collapsing too. We can now say it is a national security problem,"" said Dr Abelardo Avila of Mexico's National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition. 

Mexicans wryly call the problem Vitamin T after all the tacos and tostadas that are gobbled up.

Many people believe that becoming obese is the result of eating too much and not exercising enough. Others argue that obesity is the result of being the unfortunate and unlucky recipient of unfavorable genes. Whichever way you sway, the question remains; can you do everything “right” and still become obese? Opinions and research pertaining to these questions vary, but one thing is for sure; the obesity epidemic is harming Americans in more ways than one. 
Food is powerful. It brings people together and may alter the mood of any circumstance or interaction. Think about it: when you gather with friends, how often is food involved? When you have a reason to celebrate, is food one of the first things that you think of? When you’ve had a bad day, do you reach for that tub of ice cream or order that extra cheesy pizza to comfort yourself? 
Most people enjoy food and don’t want to give up the pleasures that it brings. So, how does America tackle this issue collectively? Do people even realize how the growing rate of obesity has impacted America, or are most people immune to the changes and accommodations that obesity requires? 
You probably know about plus size clothing, but did you know that plus size caskets are also a thing? That’s right. Caskets have increased in size in order to accommodate the rising number of obesity-related deaths in the US. However, caskets aren’t the only thing that has had to change in size to accommodate America’s growth in size. This video will uncover the shocking and eye-opening realities of obesity.
And, if you think you’re immune to the entanglement that obesity ensues, we have bad news for you. Even if you aren’t obese yourself, you are still being impacted by this growing epidemic. The financial burdens of obesity don’t contain themselves when it comes to medical costs and are more widespread than you may think. Watch this video to learn just how much obesity costs Americans each year.
However uncomfortable the topic may be, it is important to keep obesity in the forefront of people’s minds and conversations. Without knowledge of the growing epidemic, what it entails, and how to prevent oneself from falling victim to it, obesity will only keep growing.
It’s common for individuals, especially children, to be influenced by their environment, peers, and family members and adopt certain behaviors that they view as “normal.” The more normalized obesity becomes, the farther away a solution remains. 
Not everyone can be a doctor or dietician and fight the problem from a medical standpoint, but you can do your part to make an impact. Watching videos like this and sharing them with your network is a small and minimally time-consuming action that you can take today to keep the conversation going about how to fight the obesity epidemic and end it for good. By solving the problem today, we are opening the door for future generations to focus on other areas of improvement, innovation, and acceleration within America, and the rest of the world.

Childhood Obesity is a serious epidemic in North America.  Nearly a third of our children are overweight or obese,...and the numbers continue to rise.
At younger and younger ages, Doctors are treating children with significant medical complications related to being obese, such as, Type-2 Diabetes, Hypertension, and elevated Cholesterol.  

We're at risk of raising supersized kids who may live sicker and die younger than the generation before them.

""Our Supersized Kids"" profiles four families whose grade school children are overweight or obese.  Each of these families are actively working to help their child turn around an out-of-control weight gain.  The documentary highlights their struggles and successes, along with providing helpful tips from Pediatricians.

Im not getting on any ""high horse"" or trying to belittle anyone. The Road to vastly bad health was terrifying me and I wanted to change it. But This most recent change was a big one and I couldnt ignore it anymore.

VISIT: https://LoriMichelle.net 

In the next program of Running on Love with GOD we will discuss the obesity crises around the world. A recent study of the OECD reported that Britain’s obesity problem has doubled in just 20 years making it Europe’s most obese country. The United states maintains leadership in obesity worldwide. Why are most people from developed countries becoming overweight or obese? Is everyone who is overweight simply lazy? Hashem GOD has told me repeatedly, “Everything is measured”. Our body weight is one measure that tells us if we have a problem. The obesity phenomenon reveals something far more sinister than weight gain. Obesity, disease, drug abuse, mental illness, and all the health problems growing rapidly around the world come from the same source: EVIL. When we choose evil, the opposite of godliness, Hashem God allows us to receive the results.  We can solve these problems but only if we learn where they are truly coming from and choose better. Listen, learn, and work for peace now. Our lives depend up everyone waking up and doing this work.

Listen. Learn. Work for Peace.

Despite years of attention and growing concern about the childhood obesity problem, the US may still lag behind.

A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that the United States' neighbors to the north may be faring better in the fight against childhood obesity.

""About one-quarter of Canadian adults and more than one-third of adults in the United States are obese,"" wrote lead study author Margaret D. Carroll, MSPH, of CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and colleagues. ""Obese children are at risk of becoming obese adults and can experience immediate health consequences such as psychosocial stress, elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, and abnormal glucose tolerance.""","Childhood Obesity Rates: Canada Vs. the US"

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2rAAQPL 

People are fatter than ever. Obesity has more than doubled since 1980. But the biggest rise is in the developing world.

Anyone with a body mass index, or BMI, over 30 is considered obese. The higher your BMI, the greater your risk of developing weight-related diseases like diabetes and heart disease.

Nearly half of the world’s overweight and obese children under five years old, live in Asia. And in Africa, the number of overweight children under five has increased by nearly 50% since 2000.
 
Hunger still blights many parts of the world. But the share of people who do not have enough to eat is in decline. Globally one in nine people in the world suffer from chronic undernourishment.

One in ten are obese. 

If current trends continue, the share of obese children in the world will surpass the number of undernourished by 2022. 

Africa has the fastest-growing middle class in the world. A move from traditional foods to high-calorie fast food and a more sedentary lifestyle is driving the rise in obesity. Fast food outlets like KFC and McDonalds have seen rapid growth on the continent. 

Women appear to be most affected. More than half of women in Botswana are overweight. Ethiopia known for its terrible famine, has seen obesity rates in women rise by 600% since 1984.

Health systems in Africa, more focused on treating malnourishment and diseases like malaria and HIV, are ill equipped to deal with obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes. 

Pacific islands have the highest obesity rates in the world, thanks to the spread of western fast food. Diets which a generation ago consisted of fish and coconuts are now dominated by processed meat.

Nauru is top of the list. 61% of the population are obese, making this tiny paradise island the world’s fattest nation. 

Cook Islands take second place, with an obesity rate of 56% and Marshall Islands come in third, with 53%.

The Middle East is also in the grip of an obesity crisis. In the Saudi Arabia and Qatar and Kuwait more than a third of the population is obese. 

Obesity is already a global epidemic and is rapidly spreading from the rich world to the poor.

China is on track to have more obese children than any other country by 2025, according to the World Obesity Federation. The report says 48.5 million Chinese children are expected to be obese, with many suffering diseases like diabetes and heart failure. It is far more than the projected figures of the US (17.3 million) and India (16.7 million).

Thirty years of rising living standards have left Qatar with an epidemic of obese children. Now doctors are trying to tighten belts and stem the tide on a major health problem that could have far reaching consequences.

At the beginning I was fine, until I was in the third year at primary school. Then the Gulf tummy started to grow explains Moaz, who suffered from obesity all through his childhood. A sharp rise in economic affluence, increasingly westernized diets and low exercise rates has lead to an explosion in the country's levels of obesity. 40% of Qataris are now obese and 20% suffer from diabetes, with 75% of diabetics under 45 years of age. As Dr Taheri explains, the effects could be far reaching. ""They are going to be affected at a very young age with heart disease, problems with cancer, dementia, things that are going to affect the nation in the long term."" Doctors like Taheri are hoping that a strict program of prevention, enforcing healthy diets and exercise regimes upon the nation's schoolchildren will be enough to limit the impact.

Corrina counts down the 10 worst foods you could eat in terms of weight gain and obesity. Chances are if you eat an average American diet, you ate at least three of these this week.  These are the foods that will make you fat. 

In a fast food nation, eating #healthy food becomes difficult to do. Yet a poor diet contributes to low energy, obesity, stress, health problems and high medical bills. 

If you eat better, you will feel better and this video discusses some of the foods you should avoid. Fitness, health and wellness depend on good nutrition.

ABOUT THIS VIDEO: This video covers an article from the New England Journal of Medicine. Ward and his associates developed projections based on NHANES (National Health And Nutrition Survey) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey since the early 1990s. The bottom line: By 2030, over half of the people in the US would have a BMI over 30. Moreover, over 1 in 4 would have a BMI greater than 35, and that's called morbid obesity. (Morbid means it's having immediate & obvious terrible effects on health.) While the methods used were sound, I am optimistic we can still prevent such things from happening.

Dr. Brewer provides services via telemedicine or in-person if you're in the Lexington, KY area. We find a lot of undiagnosed prediabetes or insulin resistance. Treating unrecognized risk factors like prediabetes allows the reduction of risk and prevention of disease.

The obesity battle is going pear-shaped real quick according to this study. Healthcare costs and obesity-related diseases are expected to sharply increase in all states by 2030, with Mississippi bearing the worst of it.

Current obesity rates hover at around 35 percent. By 2030 this number could increase to 60 percent or more. The study also points out that along with the increase in obesity, there will be more cases of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and strokes, hypertension and arthritis.

https://youtu.be/01QQWQGGFoI


Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat addition that may ruin health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).
Adults
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:
• Overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
• Obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.


What causes obesity and overweight?
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been:
• an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat; and
• an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.


Record numbers of Americans are obese, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 70% of Americans are now either obese or overweight by this measure. However, the statistics are particularly worrying. Almost 40% of adults are obese. The childhood obesity rate, for ages 6-19, has increased to 20%.
Childhood obesity is linked to increased mortality rates in adulthood, and obesity can lead to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
It’s hardly a uniquely American problem though — the World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the number of obese kids and adolescents has risen tenfold over the last four decades, around the world.

Processed Foods Are Universal
Americans who are poor and obese don’t live in a food desert, they may live in an area where frozen corn dogs sold at the local dollar store are more affordable than fresh fruits and vegetables sold in a supermarket.
Nonstop Stress
From job insecurity and high unemployment to a dysfunctional health insurance system, life has becoming increasingly stressful in the U.S.—and research shows a strong link between stress and weight gain.
Poor Work/Life Balance
Seven Powerful Ideas That Influence the Way We Think has pointed out that obesity is one of the results of Americans’ poor work/life balance.
Lack of Universal Healthcare
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 has given millions of previously uninsured Americans access to health insurance. But millions of other Americans remain uninsured, and cut off from things that discourage obesity, such as programs promoting wealth loss or weight management. 
Powerful Junk Food Lobby
The lobby that’s doing the most to promote poor health may very well be the junk food lobby, which spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy in Washington, DC. 

WHO response
Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2004, the ""WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health"" describes the actions needed to support healthy diets and regular physical activity. The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.

The lockdown decreed to try and control the pandemic rendered innumerable city and town workers unemployed, unpaid, unable to rent or eat, and transportless. With no other choice, they started walking thousands of kilometres, parched and hungry under the burning summer sun, to go back to their villages, many accompanied by frail and starving family members. Some never made it, others eventually stumbled to their village border, often to be met with hostility – possible carriers of a deadly infection; unexpected extra mouths to feed. These were all people who were the fuel that ran the towns and cities: factory workers, construction labour, electricians, plumbers, delivery boys, shop assistants, newspaper vendors, sellers of fruit and vegetables, laundrymen, eatery cooks and waiters, tea boys, taxi drivers, domestic staff: all of whom arrived from who knew where each morning and removed themselves to who knew where each night. All of whom suddenly became “migrants”. What do you do when your land becomes “the mouth of a shark”. What policies, failures and inefficiencies let down those who support the weight of our cities, when they most needed support. Is the existence of an urban worker inevitably precarious. Is it possible to work towards ensuring a safety net. Surely these are questions that merit urgent attention – and answers.

The very first McDonald's restaurant appeared in Kuwait on a U.S. military base set up to support the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, the industry has rapidly expanded — there are now hundreds of U.S. fast food restaurants in Kuwait and as a result, the country has become one of the most obese nations on the planet. 

""The begining of fast food, I would say it is part of the Americanization of the culture here."" Dr. Mohsen Bagnied, a professor at the American University of Kuwait told VICE News. Now, Kuwait has roughly double the percentage of diabetic adults than the U.S. 

​The fast food industry isn't just operating in the Middle East. American Fast food brands populate more than 100 countries around the world, occupying six continents. And the global fast food industry is projected to be worth over $600 billion by 2019. 

VICE's Gianna Toboni travels to Kuwait to witness the health effects on a country deep in the throes of an unlikely obsession with U.S. fast food.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBTUcBgBVV4","What are the top 10 causes of obesity in children and which ones can be reduced or prevented?

We can group the top 10 into 5 broad categories, each with two key factors:
 
• The first category is Diet -- Arguably the most important contributor to the childhood obesity epidemic is consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.  Sugary calories in liquid form seem to slip under the body weight regulating radar system to a considerable degree, leading to weight gain for susceptible individuals.  In a recent randomized controlled trial from the New Balance Center Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital, we found that adolescents who eliminated sugary beverages weighed about 4 lb less after a year, than those who continued their usual beverage habits.  Among Hispanics, the effects were especially large: 14 lb difference after 1 year.

Learn more about sugary drinks impact on weight gain:
http://childrenshospitalblog.org/home...

A more general dietary cause is what can be termed ""ultra-processed products"" -- made in a factory, with a long-list of artificial ingredients, and little resemblance to anything found in nature. Ultraprocessed products are concentrated in calories, but almost totally devoid in nutrition, leading to weight gain and a long list of diet-related chronic diseases.  Even 5 year old patients in our clinic can understand this basic concept: if it comes from a factory instead of nature, just don't eat it! 

Fake food:
http://childrenshospitalblog.org/fake...

The Low-Glycemic Diet:
http://childrenshospital.org/clinical...


• The second category is Physical activity and inactivity -- TV viewing is in close competition with sugary beverages as the leading driver of excessive weight gain in childhood.  TV viewing causes obesity, not only by displacing physical activities, but also through incessant food advertising.  Kids see thousands of food commercial per year, overwhelmingly for high calorie, low quality products.  
Another important issue, especially for lower income and inner city children, is the lack of regular PE in schools, and safe afterschool recreation opportunities.

Keep Kids Moving:
http://childrenshospitalblog.org/we-n...

• The third category is Family -- The environment outside the home has been called ""toxic"" to our ability to maintain a healthy body weight.  All too often, parents don't adequately protect the home environment and model healthy eating.  Without parental vigilance, the foods kids eat in the home can be as unhealthy as the ones outside.
 
What you can do at home: http://childrenshospital.org/clinical...

• The fourth category is Stress -- too much of it, and too little sleep.  A stressed, tired child will be less likely get off the couch and get active, and more likely to give in to dietary temptations.  In addition, stress and sleep deprivation may alter hormones and metabolism in ways that promotes weight gain.

The importance of sleep: 
http://childrenshospital.org/clinical...

• The fifth category is the Environment -- and most importantly, our car-based transportation system.  Entire suburbs now lack any public transportation, and even sidewalks. To make matters worse, many neighborhoods also lack community parks, playgrounds and bike paths for safe, active recreation.","Top 10 causes of obesity in children - Boston Children's Hospital - Top 20 Health Challenges"

While the overall numbers for childhood obesity have stayed relatively stable over the years, certain subsets of the population are at greater risk. A new study published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that for those at the extreme percentiles, the danger is growing worse.

Ashely Cockrell Skinner, Assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina says that the reasons behind obesity is manifold. She says nutrition, activity level, and genetics all play a role, but also believes that hormones and food additives change the way we metabolize our food.","Children obesity rates in America not improving"

Obesity in America has changed us from a nation of slim healthy people to a majority of obese unhealthy people in just 50 years. It’s time we learn the truth about Obesity in America.


Today, obesity in America, affects almost every family in the nation. During the past 50 years, most people have tried to diet, at least once, often dozens of times. During the same period, We have been offered more diets, and more weight loss solutions than we’ll ever be able to count. They have one thing in common, they have all failed to conquer obesity.

What most people don’t realize, is that just 50 years ago, the vast majority of Americans were still slim and healthy. We ate by intuition, and obesity in American did not exist. Dieting was very uncommon, reserved mainly for Diabetics and people who had a Thyroid Condition. Today, obesity in America has become almost inevitable for everybody.  That is not acceptable. It’s time we open our eyes to some unpleasant truth’s we seem determined to ignore.

Obesity is not natural, and we must not think of it as Normal.  Obesity is not normal, it’s dangerous and it kills people. The fact is, it has an origin and it has a cause. It exists because it is founded on an addiction.  Unfortunately, the power behind obesity, is a brutal industry that has no moral boundaries and operates exclusively for profit.  50 years ago, that industry sat on the sidelines, trying to find a way to break our basic instinct, Intuitive Eating.  It was the only thing that stood in their way.

It prevented them from becoming the source of all the food we eat every day. Till then, all our food was provided by growers, dairy farmers and meat producers. This was an industry, ready and eager to substitute those foods, with processed, artificial foods that would create new, much bigger markets of people who would become addicted to the new food. They would be forced to ignore the old food and replace it with addictive driven products that were literally irresistible.

There is no bigger, better, more profitable industry, than one that can be based on an addiction, particularly an addiction sanctioned even approved by those who are supposed to protect us. The only thing that stood in their way was an age old intuitive system, that had kept us slim and healthy for generations. It relied on our basic instinct, intuitive eating, that guided us intuitively to the right food.

Obesity in America was a goal, a target to get people addicted to fake food. It meant intuitive eating had to be broken. The amazing details of how this was done is told in the soon to be launched: The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat. Don’t miss it!

The obesity epidemic in America is an increasing problem, and it seems to be spreading globally.  The choices that we make about what we feed our families depend on a lot of factors, and no matter how hard we try, we live in a country that can seem to be a massive food fair.  Processed foods and fast-food restaurants are everywhere we look, and largely due to advertising & marketing influences, it has become socially acceptable to eat these foods at any time.  But a lot of people are beginning to recognize the problem, and they are taking positive steps to ensure the future health of their families.

Script:

Here’s a riddle:

How is it that ever since the government began telling us what to eat, we have gotten fatter and sicker?

In 1977, when the government first set dietary guidelines, the average American male weighed 170 pounds. He now weighs 197. It’s not any better for women —145 to 170. And you don’t need an academic study to know the same thing is happening to kids. Just look around. 

The weight gain has real-life consequences:  the percentage of Americans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes—a condition that can lead to severe medical issues—has risen from 2% in 1977 to over 9% in 2015. In hard numbers, that’s five million people to over 30 million people.

How did this happen?

It all started innocently enough in the 1950s, when President Dwight Eisenhower had a heart attack while in office. Suddenly, the issue of heart health became a national obsession. 

Keep in mind this was an era when scientists had harnessed the power of the atom, unlocked the secrets of DNA, and cured once incurable diseases like polio. Surely, there had to be a scientific solution to heart disease. 

There was. And a charismatic medical researcher from the University of Minnesota named Ancel Keyes had it.

Cholesterol, Keyes claimed, was the villain of the heart disease story. 

His now famous “seven countries study” determined conclusively—in his mind, at least—that people who consumed high amounts of fat—specifically, saturated fat—had higher cholesterol levels and thus, higher rates of heart attacks. 

Lower your fat intake, and you would lower heart disease risk. 

The ever-confident Keyes spread the gospel. As an influential member of the American Heart Association, he was in a very strong position to do so. There was only one problem: Keyes’s study was bad science. The sample size was so small, the data collection integrity so shoddy, and the life-style variables between the countries he studied so great, that his research had no scientific validity. In other words, he asserted a conclusion he couldn’t prove. 

When other scientists questioned Keyes’s conclusions, they were invariably met with stern responses like: “people are dying while you’re quibbling over data points.” And, “there are great benefits and no risks” to adopting this new way of eating.

In 1973, the American Heart Association set the dietary limit on saturated fat at 10%, and in 1977, the US government followed suit. Where did the 10% value come from? It didn’t come from any scientific data. It was merely a government committee’s best guess.  

This was despite contrary evidence like the 1957 Western Electric Company employee study showing no difference in heart attacks in those who ate more or less saturated fat. A longer-term study of the same Western Electric subjects in 1981 reached the same conclusion. But again, no one wanted to hear it.  

To make this all easier to understand and to spread the message to schools, “the food pyramid” was created. That’s the chart you first saw in third or fourth grade with all the supposedly good foods at the bottom—meaning, “eat a lot of those,” and the bad foods at the top—""eat those ones sparingly.” 

What our kids are fed in school, what our military troops are fed on bases, what sick people are fed in hospitals; what crops we plant and how we raise our cattle, are all predicated on this deceptive nutritional concept.

At 5.7 feet tall, he weighs over 150 kilograms (330.7 lbs).
Wang has been been attending this weight loss training camp in Beijing for one week. He says he joined up because he had started to feel that his weight was threatening his health:
""Some friends of mine like me are getting cerebral thrombosis and haemorrhages only in their mid thirties. This makes me realise that it's quite easy for overweight guys like us to get these diseases. That's why I'm here to reduce my weight.""
For 24-year-old Wang Tuantuan, being over-weight means mockery and discrimination. She says she cannot find a job or a partner because of her weight.
She was 145 kilograms (320 lbs) when she started attending the camp two months ago. She now weighs 117 kilograms (258 lbs). Her aim is to lose another 57 kilograms (126 lbs).
""When my weight is reduced to 60 kilos (132 lbs), I will no longer suffer from huge mental stress and psychological pressure. I will become more confident walking in the street. Then I can find a good man to establish a good family. My whole life will become excellent and I think this is the ultimate dream of all girls.""
There are more than 40 people enrolled at the camp on courses ranging from 20 to 80 days.  Food intake is rigorously controlled. 
Lunch today is no more than 50 grams of rice with sliced pork, a small amount of fried egg, tomato, carrot, hot pepper, cucumber and one chicken leg.
Snacks and carbonated drinks are strictly forbidden. No one is allowed to leave the camp during the course.
Participants spend four or five hours every day working out in the gym and doing aerobic exercises to ensure that they burn 2000 to 3000 calories a day.
Demand for the courses is high. Camp founder, Yang Tao says the number of the participants  has been increasing by 30% a year in the five years since the camp has been open. He says because of space limitations, it is difficult for him to accept more than around 40 people at any one time:
""Living conditions are better. People are eating better food than before. However people are not selective enough in front of food. They are stuffing all kinds of delicious food into their mouths and have become fond of eating. This has tremendously increased the burden on our bodies.  Most of them were over-weight by 30 (66.1 lbs) to 150 kilos (330.7 lbs) when they arrived and many of them were actually sick."" 
Some obese and overweight people in China look to traditional Chinese medicine for help.
In a clinic south of Beijing, doctor Liu Meiqing is administering acupuncture on a patient hoping to lose weight.
Practitioners of the ancient Chinese method believe that blood circulation and  ""Qi"" - the vital energy the body absorbs from the external world - are the key to maintaining good health.  Together blood and Qi nourish the body and take away harmful objects.
Liu claims that acupuncture stimulates blood circulation and so stops the accumulation of fat:
""The main purpose of acupuncture is to adjust the Qi and blood. When the Qi and blood inside the body become exuberant and the circulation is vigorous, no fat is accumulated. This is an amazing heritage our ancestors passed down to us.""

Transcript:
The human body runs on food. Where once, food shortage was the major concern, after the Second World War, technological advances in food production led to a new era that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food and relatively little physical activity.

In the decades that followed, other socio-cultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate: women who had previously controlled most of the average family’s food preparation, now entered the workforce in significant numbers and the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food. 

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home and, since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person’s caloric intake increased dramatically.

Michael Pollan: And it is no coincidence, because to the extent we outsource our food, first, we eat less healthy food, more salt, fat, and sugar, but we also eat more food, because processed food is often designed as snack food. And marketed to us as a way to eat continually through the day.

These changes in the way we, as a society, ate, led to the emergence of obesity as a recognized chronic disease with well-defined health consequences.  And medical recommendations were made to try and address those consequences.

In the second half of the 20th century, a lot of attention was focused on reducing saturated fat and total fat in our diets and the processed food industry responded by giving us what we wanted. 

But they still had a vested interest in selling their products, so they found other ways to make their reduced-fat products taste good – one way they did this was by adding significantly more sugar, and other forms of sugar like corn syrup, to almost everything we ate.

This not only made the reduced-fat foods more appealing, but it also increased their shelf-life, so the food industry had a huge incentive to add corn syrup and other sweeteners to packaged foods. The resulting increase in our intake of simple sugars, fueled our modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

But now, we may be at risk of making the same mistake again. If we only emphasize the need to cut down on our sugar intake, without simultaneously emphasizing moderation and balance in our diet as a whole, we risk a situation where fats and animal proteins are seen by the general public as “free food” and the processed food industry, again steps in and supersizes… If this happens, we could find ourselves facing new epidemics of disease associated with a diet that is too high in fat and animal proteins, and lacking in fiber. 

Pollan: It's been interesting to read the research and see the shift in attention from treating fat as the evil nutrient to treating sugar as the evil nutrient. Now we went overboard on fat. It turns out fat is not as evil as we thought, and saturated fat is not necessarily the thing to worry most about in your diet. And in fact, our obsession with saturated fat led us to promote trans fats, which turned out to actually be lethal. So I'm very wary of focusing all our attention on a single nutrient. Sugar has been part of the human diet for a very long time. It's prized by people all over the world. We have evolved to like the flavor of sugar for very good reasons. But we are eating too much of it.

These shifts in our food consumption patterns have led us to a point in history where a physiological adaptation, our ability to store energy as fat, has become maladaptive. 

The balance between food availability and energy expenditure has been disrupted and it’s left us with an exponential increase in the incidence of obesity over the past 60 years, an epidemic that the World Health Organization has labeled “a worldwide public-health crisis”.

Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly provides a biomedical perspective of obesity, and evaluates which genes could potentially shift the balance towards obesity.

Easy access to nutrients has contributed to the increase in obesity in the human population. But, what is obesity and why isn’t everybody fat? Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly provides a biomedical perspective of obesity, and evaluates which genes could potentially shift the balance towards obesity. As he explains, one becomes obese when the balance between energy intake and energy spent is shifted. Surprisingly, mutations that lead to obesity in humans aren’t in genes involved in metabolism and energy storage, but failure in satiety signals in the brain that result in people eating too much. The excess of energy intake over energy expenditure leads to obesity.

What is the consequence of obesity in human health? Physically, obesity can result in lower mobility and sleeping disorders. But, in humans, the link between obesity and metabolic diseases isn’t straightforward. For example, not everyone that’s obese becomes insulin resistant. As O'Rahilly explains, the probability of an obese individual to have a metabolic disease is linked to the capacity of adipose tissue to store the extra fat. Mutations that decrease fat storage in adipose tissue increase the chance of metabolic diseases, like insulin resistance, even when the person is not obese.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly is a professor of Clinical Biochemistry and Medicine and Head of the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge where he also directs the MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit in the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science. He qualified in Medicine from University College Dublin, and continued his post-graduate training at Oxford University and Harvard Medical School. In 1991, O'Rahilly joined the faculty at Cambridge University where he studies human metabolic and endocrine diseases. O'Rahilly is known for his work in identifying novel extreme human metabolic phenotypes, and identifying genes important in metabolic function and dysfunction.

For his scientific contributions, O'Rahilly was elected as a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999), and the Royal Society (2003). He also became a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (2011), was knighted in the 2013 Birthday Honors for services to medical research and was the 2019 Banting Medal Recipient for Scientific Achievement of the American Diabetes Association.

--------------------
Globally, an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980. The global prevalence of diabetes has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult population. This reflects an increase in associated risk factors such as being overweight or obese. Over the past decade, diabetes prevalence has risen faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and lower limb amputation. Healthy diet, physical activity and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. In addition diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with medication, regular screening and treatment for complications.

In 2007 General Assembly adopted resolution 61/225 designating 14 November as World Diabetes Day. The document recognized “the urgent need to pursue multilateral efforts to promote and improve human health, and provide access to treatment and health-care education.”

The resolution also encouraged Member States to develop national policies for the prevention, treatment and care of diabetes in line with the sustainable development of their health-care systems.","Qatar: Sweet Epidemic (Diabetes)"

Two-thirds of us are already overweight and there's no doubt that our poor diet and lack of exercise is slowly killing us, as well as crippling the NHS. After smoking, obesity is the next biggest cause of premature death in the UK.

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is on a mission to try and do something about it. In this new series, he pushes some of the biggest food companies and restaurant chains to become more transparent about what they are selling, and he asks the government what they are doing to tackle this health crisis. Hugh also sees if it is possible to change the eating habits of a whole city by challenging the people of Newcastle to lose 100,000lbs in a year.

Bad eating habits start when we are children. To prove this is true Hugh asks a group of seven-year-olds to do the weekly supermarket shop without their parents. Unsurprisingly, most of the kids head for the cereal section, where they pick from any number of brightly coloured, highly sugared breakfast cereals. But do their parents realise how much sugar is in the boxes?

Hugh also challenges the big brands over their lack of transparency when it comes to their cereal labels. All the supermarket own-brand cereals carry traffic-light labelling, which clearly shows in red, green or amber how much sugar is in the box - so why don't the market leaders?

In Newcastle, Hugh kicks off his ambitious project to see how much weight a city can lose over the course of a year. But after launching 'Newcastle Can' in the city centre, a passer-by stops Hugh to tell him that he is talking to the wrong people. If he really wants to make significant change, he needs to go and talk to people who live in more deprived parts of the city to understand the challenges they face.

Finally, Hugh meets a local bus driver who wants to lose weight but is addicted to snacking. This encounter encourages him to look at the increasing number of retailers who are tempting us into buying sweet treats on the go. Many of the major supermarkets have committed to stop selling confectionary at their checkouts, so why are other types of shops still doing it? As an experiment, Hugh sets up a replica of one chain's confectionary-laden checkout in a busy shopping street.

Two out of three adults and one out of three children in the United States are overweight or obese, and the nation spends an estimated $190 billion a year treating obesity-related health conditions. Rising consumption of sugary drinks has been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic. A typical 20-ounce soda contains 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar and upwards of 240 calories. A 64-ounce fountain cola drink could have up to 700 calories.  People who drink this ""liquid candy"" do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food and do not compensate by eating less.

This video addresses how dominant the Coca Cola Company has been in developing countries. Research shows that Coca Cola has come to dominate even rural areas, especially if they have increased tourism. Thomas Leatherman calls this Coca Colonization. This new economy that Coca Cola helps establish disrupts local farming activities, which strengthens the power food companies have in these areas. Imperialism of coke
