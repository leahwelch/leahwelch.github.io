Half Samoan, half black Facebook star Teine Meauli was shopping at her local Samoan grocery store when a Samoan man disses her in Samoan. 

The man says 'Look at this Black lady, she's buying Samoan Food'
Teine Meauli replies back in Samoan 'Watch the words that come from your mouth or I'll throw this packet of noodles over your head'

The Samoan man in disbelief and amazement swears at her and Teine Meauli doesn't hold back!

Hello and welcome to the World of Micah! I travel around filming everything and anything I find interesting –from theme parks to abandoned urban exploring. If you enjoy learning more about Disney history, tips & secrets or a fan of Disney World nostalgia you have come to the right place. I also enjoy showing Universal Studios history and taking a look of what’s left of from classic attractions like JAWS and ‪Back to the Future‬. More of an Urban Exploring fan? I travel around Central Florida and film everything from abandoned Toys “R” Us stores to abandoned attractions.

Tongan (lea faka-Tonga)
Native to: Tonga; significant immigrant community in New Zealand and the United States
Native speakers: 187,000 / 96,000 in Tonga (1998)
73,000 elsewhere, primarily in NZ, U.S., and Australia
Language family: Austronesian

is an Austronesian language of the Polynesian branch spoken in Tonga. It has around 187,000 speakers and is a national language of Tonga. It is a VSO (verb–subject–object) language.

Tongan is one of the multiple languages in the Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages, along with Hawaiian, Māori, Samoan and Tahitian, for example. Together with Niuean, it forms the Tongic subgroup of Polynesian.

Tongan is unusual among Polynesian languages in that it has a so-called definitive accent. As with all Polynesian languages, Tongan has adapted the phonological system of proto-Polynesian.

Tongan has retained the original proto-Polynesian *h, but has merged it with the original *s as /h/. (The /s/ found in modern Tongan derives from *t before high front vowels). Most Polynesian languages have lost the original proto-Polynesian glottal stop /q/; however, it has been retained in Tongan and a few other languages including Rapa Nui.
In proto-Polynesian, *r and *l were distinct phonemes, but in most Polynesian languages they have merged, represented orthographically as r in most East Polynesian languages, and as l in most West Polynesian languages. However, the distinction can be reconstructed because Tongan kept the *l but lost the *r.
Tongan has heavily influenced the Wallisian language after Tongans colonized the island of ʻUvea in the 15th and 16th centuries.","The Sound of the Tongan Language (Numbers, Greetings & Sample Text)"

Tarisi Vunidilo introduces the method and style of a Fijian lovo as practiced in urban Auckland, Aotearoa, today. Her process is setup like this:

1. Prepare a menu for the number of people (volume of food is important)
2. Lovo consists of - meat, chicken & pork, vegetables; palusami and root crops: dalo, tavioka and kumala.
3. Make sure you have enough firewood, large banana leaves and stones for the lovo pit.
4. Prepare your meat by marinating (overnight) and wrap in foil.
5. Prepare your palusami (see our 'how to make palusami item for more)
6. Peel dalo and cassava ready for the lovo
7. Light the fire for the lovo, enough to heat the stones, then throw the firewood out leaving only the hot stones in the pit.
8. Line the food you are planning to cook, on top of the stones.
9. Food to be covered by green leaves to keep the steam in, then cover with soil (or sacks of potatoes and tarpolin). Food will take 60 - 90 minutes to cook.

From the story of the six Tongan boys stranded on a desert island in 1965. You can read it here. http://paradise.docastaway.com/six-to... 

In 1966 an Australian fishing boat, the Just David, was looking for new crayfish grounds. They put down some traps without much success off the island of Ata in Tonga. To the crew surprise six naked boys screeming for attention swam straight to the boat and they told the story: This is what the Australian captain Peter Warner from Brisbane wrote in his memories: 


""After recovering our empty cray pots, we decided to have a closer look and investigate the burned out patches on this stark “steep to” island. We approached first the eastern face and then rounded the northern corner to investigate the western lee side. 

Everywhere thick clouds of screaming seabirds of all types swirled around the cliffs and over our small vessel. From the crows nest, our look out cried “I can hear a human voice yelling”. “Nonsense “ said I “it’s only screaming seabirds,” . 

But we spotted a brown body hurtling down a cliff path and diving into the surf. He looked wild and screamed loud bloodcurdling noises. With no clothes at all, and hair grown into a huge black top-heavy “gollywog” bush, the healthy youngster swam towards us using the style of the Australian crawl. 

I ordered the crew to load the rifles below and stand by to repel boarders because now a few more brown figures were seen swimming towards us. My first thoughts were, that this place must be some be some sort of prison island for desperate Tongan thugs and outcasts. Exile was a common practice in Polynesia, sometimes in a leaky canoe.

 After his Olympic winning swim from the shore, a big pearly white smile from the kid alongside with the exploded hair do, calmed my nerves. We lowered the boarding ladder and the 18-year-old heaved himself aboard, stark naked, and announced in perfect aristocratic English “My name is Steven. 

There are 6 of us and we estimate we have been here between one and two years”. Good story thought I but I don’t believe it. By this time the others had boarded and introduced themselves we continued to drift and I continued to think. Even if they were all young jailbirds, we did not wish to scare them. Their explanation continued. 

They alleged that 5 of them came from the Haapai group of islands in Tonga, where fish is a staple daily diet, but had all been sent as boarders at St Andrews Anglican high School in Nuku’alofa the capital of Tonga. The food at the school was so horrible, that they had “borrowed’ a long boat one evening and sailed out to catch some fish. 

This was the official story that they all stuck to for the time being. Details of this 8 day survival trip were explained to us during the first night they slept on ‘Just David”. But first we had to consider what to do with 6 dripping and very healthy boys in the after cockpit. We figured that if their story was indeed true, they had spent about 18 months on the island. Still suspicious, I wrote down the names of the 6 with spelling help from them. Then I raised Nuku’alofa Radio on short wave and after sorting out a working frequency, asked the shore operator to contact St Andrews college by phone and ask the staff if they had the 6 named boys as students 18 months ago. 


The Tongan operator asked me to stand-by whilst he investigated. Meanwhile our cook had prepared our daily meal, which the boys shared with us and immediately vomited up, not being used to European style food for so long. A very emotional and tearful Nuku’alofa Radio operator came back on the air and announced That St Andrew’s College confirmed that 5 of the 6 named boys were students at the school but they all had been given up as dead long ago when, the open boat, missing from its anchorage, never returned. 

One father had spent months looking for them on uninhabited islands but finally resigned himself to their disappearance. Funeral services for all 6 boys had been held, but miraculously we had found them alive and very healthy. We all relaxed, unloaded the firearms, and gave some clothes to our new friends. A temporary anchorage was found and we resolved that next day, we would sail to Nuku’alofa. 

But first we were to be given a guided tour of the Island tomorrow and tonight listen to the story of the 8 day drift. the board, and many more to come. Explained Peter Warner in his memories... Peter is a good friend of Mano Totau and they both live in Brisbane, Australia. You can find out more of the real Lord of the Flies story here http://paradise.docastaway.com/six-to...

About This Episode:
Today is all about the most famous dish in all of Cebu, lechon. I visit Rico's Lechon taking a tour with the bossman himself. Rico shows me how to stuff a pig, how they're roasted up and finally, and most importantly, how to eat this plate of yum. While at Rico's we also try out their famous Sisig and damn...I have seen the light. Like a junkie who's turned to jesus, I am born again with a taste of pig face. That makes sense, right? Hit up Rico's for a taste explosion.

I am excited to finally be back on the vlog! It has been a very long time so I do apologize for my absence family! In this vlog we are going to be cooking PĪSUA or Samoan coconut jelly. A favourite for our Samoan people! 

Also we will be talking over where I have been for the past month briefly and also some very special mentions as well! Thankyou for your continuous support for this channel! Shoutout to everyone who are new to this channel! Don't forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE!

Full Recipe 

Ingredients 
600g tapioca pearls 
4 cups raw sugar
1 litre coconut cream 
1 lemon rind 
1 cup water 

1. Soak tapioca pearls in water in an oven tray overnight. The next day foil the pearls and bake in an oven at 160 degrees for 90mins or until the pearls have become transparent and cooked right through. 
2. Melt sugar until burning point and sugar boils/bubbles up. Move to another element on oven and once cooled add half cup water and coconut cream. Then add lemon rind. Be sure to take out lemon rind before adding to tapioca.
3. Once cooked, cool the tapioca pearls until solidified. Scoop the tapioca into a bowl and mix with the coconut sugar syrup. 
4. Be sure to use the wooden spoon to break down the tapioca, mixing well. 
5. Place in the fridge to set for 1hour and serve. Enjoy! (Serves 8)

Bethany loves going to the Polynesian in Disneyworld to the cute restaurant Kona and getting Tonga Toast, deep fried french toast, a banana inside, and drizzled strawberry compote on top, YUM! If you like a sweet breakfast, you will fall in love with this recipe and want to make it at home too, so here it is: 

TONGA TOAST
Ingredients:
2 slices sourdough bread, cut 1½ inches thick
1 banana
1/3 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of cinnamon
1 egg
¼ cup of milk
½ teaspoon of vanilla
Vegetable oil or shortening for frying
Whipped butter and/or syrup

Directions:
Put about four inches of oil or shortening into a good-sized pot (such as a Dutch oven).

Heat the oil/shortening to 350ºF. While that is heating up, cut a small pocket (about 1 inch in length) in the side of each bread slice.

Cut your banana in half, then cut in half again lengthwise. Remove the peel from all four parts of the banana. Now stuﬀ two pieces of banana into the pocket you cut into each slice of bread. In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar, then set aside. In a bowl larger than your piece of bread, mix the egg, milk, and vanilla, then also set aside.

Place each piece of stuﬀed bread into the bowl with egg mixture and allow it to soak for a few seconds. 

Place soaked bread into the hot oil/shortening and fry on both sides until lightly browned. When done, remove from oil and place on a plate lined with paper towels or a wire rack. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before serving.

FOR STRAWBERRY COMPOTE:
10 sliced strawberries
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup sugar

slice up 10 strawberries, place 6 of the strawberries into a small saucepan with vanilla and sugar and heat until boiling.
Remove strawberries from heat and pour the mixture into the blender with 4 non-cooked, fresh strawberries and blend well. Pour into a bowl for Tonga Toast sauce.

This is the Tongan lanuguage version of a training video made for Pacific Island artisanal fishers on methods for postharvest processing of sea cucumbers. The video was produced as part of a research aid project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR project FIS-2010-096), within the Department of Foreign Affairs, Australia. Hard copies (DVD discs) with voice-overs in local languages will be distributed to coastal villages in Fiji, Tonga and Kiribati.

Sea cucumbers have been fished in the Pacific Islands for more than 150 years. They are processed, using artisanal methods, into a dried form called bêche-de-mer and exported to China. 

Harvesting and selling sea cucumbers gives rural households vital sources of income for basic needs, health and education. In many Pacific Island villages, alternative livelihood activities are limited and fishing sea cucumbers offers one of the few income sources. 
Research shows that a majority of Pacific Island fishers have had no information support to understand how to process the animals correctly. As a result, the quality of dried products is often poor and fishers get inferior prices. This problem contributes to a need to fish large quantities of sea cucumbers to meet economic needs and wastes the potential value of these resources for national economies. 

The goal of the video is to help Pacific Island fishers to make better income from the sea cucumbers that they collect and reduce the wastage of potential income and food from these aquatic resources. The video and project discourages excessive fishing, since these resources are vulnerable to over-exploitation, and we do not encourage fishers to harvest sea cucumbers. Rather, the project hopes to improve postharvest processing of catches that would be made by existing fishers. By spending more time on value-adding of the fishery harvests and gaining a better income from selling the dried sea cucumbers for export, fishers might need to fish less frequently. Whether, or not, this occurs is being determined by 'before-and-after' socio-economic surveys as part of the research component of the project.

The video was made by Southern Cross University, Australia, through its National Marine Science Centre. Neither the funding organisation, commissioned organisation nor partner organisations that produced this DVD have any financial gain or commercial interests in the sea cucumber industry. 

The video closely follows methods presented in a training manual, which can be downloaded free at: http://aciar.gov.au/publication/cop026","Processing sea cucumbers into beche-de mer - TONGAN version - Mokohunu"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHO_RlJxnVI","This is the old documentary from 1966 about the real Lord of the Flies. The six castaway boys surviving on Ata Island in Tonga (Channel 7 in Australia)

The story of the Ata castaways reminds us of the real Lord of the Flies. These 6 kids stayed 15 on this Tongan for 15 months.

This documentary was recorded a few days after their rescue. The six boys came back to the island with Peter Warner and the TV crew. But before that they went to meet their families again and recorded their reunion after 15 months stranded on the desert island. This real Lord of the Flies story is a fascinating adventure about survival.  

The castaway explorer Alvaro Cerezo,  spent  10 days on Ata island with Kolo Fekitoa, one of the six teenage castaways.  That happened in 2015. They both lived there all alone and survived from coconuts, fish and seabirds, and drank rain water. They lived exactly as the boys did back in 1965. In summer 2020, Cerezo is launching a documentary of his experience with Kolo and a book describing in detail the 15 month ordeal of the Tongan castaways. A teaser of the documentary has been already published on Youtube. 

We have got all the rights from Bowman Studio in Australia to use these footages of the real Lord of he Flies.

Special thanks to Cheyenne Morrison for letting Alvaro know years ago about this remarkable castaway story!!!!","Six Tongan Castaways in Ata Island | OLD DOCUMENTARY CHANNEL 7"

The delicious theme-park treat is a banana and cinnamon french toast that is one of Disney's most popular recipes. For a special twist on the Tonga Toast, Olivia opted to use challah instead of sourdough. Enjoy own taste of Disney World at home.

Tonga Toast from Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort (Recipe Serves 4)
Ingredients: 
Sugar-Cinnamon 
3/4 cup granulated sugar 
2 teaspoons cinnamon 
Batter 
4 large eggs 
1 1/3 cup whole milk 
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 
1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
Tonga Toast 
1 quart canola oil, for frying 
1 loaf sourdough bread (uncut, 12 inches long) 
2 large bananas, peeled 
Directions: 
For Sugar-Cinnamon: 
Mix sugar and cinnamon in medium bowl (large enough to roll toast) with a fork until thoroughly blended.  Set aside. 
For Batter: 
Whip eggs in medium bowl (large enough to dip toast) until well beaten. Add milk, cinnamon, and sugar. Mix well and set aside.   
For Tonga Toast: 
Using caution, preheat oil to 350°F in a large pot or a deep fryer. (If using a large pot, use a candy thermometer to make certain the oil does not get any hotter or it will burn.) 
Slice the bread into four three-inch-thick slices. 
Cut each banana in half crosswise, then each piece lengthwise. 
Place a bread slice flat on the counter and tear out just enough from the middle (do not tear all the way through) to stuff half a banana into; repeat with each bread slice. 
Dip stuffed bread into batter, covering both sides, allowing excess batter to drip off bread and place carefully into hot oil. 
Cook 4-5 minutes until golden brown. If needed, turn toast over after 2 minutes and cook for another 2 minutes on other side. Remove and drain excess oil. 
Roll toast in cinnamon-sugar. Repeat for each piece of toast.","Making Tonga Toast, Disney’s Cinnamon and Banana French Toast | Chowhound at Home"

Its quick, easy and with one bite it'll remind you of a taste of home. Hope you all enjoy!! Malo!

Who do we have traning our horses now...watch and see!  We even had some Tongan friends visit the farm to prepare a pig for a Kalua pork dinner.  We tried to take out the graphic scenes but if you do not like the idea of preparing a pig for food you might want to skip out at the end of the video.  Here on the homestead, we riase pigs for food - and today was a day one left the farm to help put food on the table.  A sad day on the farm but also a day we are thankful for.

We can all agree that exercising regularly is the best way to lose weight and stay healthy. But do we exercise daily? No. Do we sleep daily? Yes. So what could be a better way to lose weight than to do so while we sleep?

The first thing you’ll need to do is boost your metabolism. As scientific studies show, cold water forces your body to burn more calories since it has to heat up to get that water in your belly warmer. The same concept works with the water you’re bathing in. By the way, all these tips will help you burn calories as you sleep. But just sleeping for 8 hours gets rid of 300 calories on its own!

In this brief video you can find seven little known facts about Tonga.

More information about the video content bellow: 
1. Tonga became known in the West as the Friendly Islands because of the congenial reception accorded to Captain James Cook on his first visit in 1773. He arrived at the time of the ʻinasi festival, the yearly donation of the First Fruits to the Tuʻi Tonga (the islands' paramount chief) and so received an invitation to the festivities. According to the writer William Mariner, the chiefs wanted to kill Cook during the gathering but could not agree on a plan.

2. The primary island, Tongatapu, has a number of tricks up its sleeve, such as the spectacular blowholes along the south western coastline. You’ll find four miles of coast with countless blowholes that can spout water 30 meters high. Go ahead and take bus from Nukualofa towards the village of Houma (Half an hour) and make sure to be there at high tide for any truly spectacular view.

3. The current royal dynasty of Tonga was founded in 1831 by Taufa’ahau Tupou, who took the name George I. He consolidated the kingdom by conquest and in 1875 granted a constitution. Tonga became independent on June 4, 1970. The government is largely controlled by the king, his nominees, and a small group of hereditary nobles.
 
4. Not much is known before European contact because of the lack of a writing system, but oral history has survived and been recorded after the arrival of the Europeans. By the 12th century, Tongans and the Tongan paramount chief, the Tuʻi Tonga, had a reputation across the central Pacific—from Niue, Samoa, Rotuma, Wallis & Futuna, New Caledonia to Tikopia—leading some historians to speak of a Tuʻi Tonga Empire.

5. Despite being a small country, Tonga has its own army. Furthermore, it participated in WWI, as part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, and in WWII. In recent times, Tongan soldiers were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq and participated in several peace keeping missions.

6. Located in Oceania, Tonga is an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, directly south of Samoa and about two-thirds of the way from Hawaii to New Zealand. Its 169 islands, 36 of them inhabited cover an 800-kilometre-long north-south line. The largest island, Tongatapu, is where the capital city of Nukuʻalofa is located.

7. The Free Wesleyan Church is the largest Methodist denomination in Tonga, and also the state church. Everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian faith; for example, all commerce and entertainment activities cease on Sunday, from the beginning of the day at midnight, to the end of the day at midnight. The constitution declares the Sabbath sacred forever.

Transcript:
One of the most universally recognized images 
of the South Pacific is the coconut palm.
It's an excellent colonizer, capable of surviving
 long periods of time floating along until chance 
might have it bump into a patch of warm soil on which to root.
 
The coconut is an indispensable ingredient
 in Polynesian life.       
Its milk provides a nourishing beverage.
It is also dried into Copra for use in cooking oil and body oil.
The coconuts are even used by children as flotation devices!
But, most of all, it is the basis for almost every traditional dish in the 
Polynesian diet.
Basic staple dishes include a concoction of Taro leaf, 
which is much like spinach when cooked,  
 onion and corned beef.  
This is wrapped in a banana leaf  
and the coconut milk is added last.  
for dessert the mixture might be papaya slices and coconut milk.
  After wrapping, the bundles are placed in the 
pre-heated Umu or underground oven along with Taro root or yams.
All families have Umus  and they're used daily.
When it is full the Umu is covered with  banana leaves and old mats
to keep in the heat.
Several hours later the bundles are removed from the Umu and  
opened to reveal succulent, savory dishes.  
For special occasions, a very large umu may be used to bake 
an entire feast.   The key to a successful umu is a tight seal 
which allows the food to be simultaneously steamed, smoked, 
 baked, and bar-b-qued.
The traditional serving plate --     
a slice from a banana tree trunk--
is as recyclable as the pot that cooked the dishes.
 And, of course, the fingers can always be used again!","Traditional Tongan cooking and food: coconuts and the Umu"

We spent our last couple of days on the resort island of Fafa, exploring the beautiful marine reserve, great food and luxurious Fales.

We made these videos as a time capsule for ourselves but also to showcase one of the less-traveled islands in the south Pacific. Before heading to Tonga, we didn't have much of an idea of what to expect. If you're thinking of heading to the islands for a holiday, check out what the Tongan Islands have to offer :)

Boat:
White Shadow is a Van De Stadt ‘Seal’ 36 (11 metres). She is hand made in steel, 2004,  with a round bilge (hull) and a modified coach roof. This makes her a ‘one off’ and in my opinion the most beautiful Van De Stadt 36 ever built.

The camera gear:
Main camera is a Panasonic Hc- V770 with a Rode External mic. My old camera is now my number 2 is a Panasonic Hc-v700. Most shots are done with an external mic (Shenggu sg 108) with a sponge and dead kitten attached.
Action stuff and small blogging is done with a Sony Hdr-as30v.
Underwater video Gopro3plus.

Editing:
Final cut pro on a Macbook. Most of the material for each video is filmed over a period of several weeks or so and the editing of each episode is normally done over a day. This process can take longer if original music is used or permissions are needed for copyrighted materials etc. Much time is spent sorting out technical problems. In this case I normally get the help of a younger person who understands computerie stuff!   
There are also times when filming, editing and uploading is not possible due to being at sea or in locations with no internet access.

Content:
I have found that filming and releasing material over a period of time is better than doing ‘vlog’ style videos and trying to make episodes out of whats happened in a week, regardless if it’s good content or not. By filming over a period of time I can be more selective in what goes into each video. My aim is to avoid ‘bland and mundane’ and have at least one or two exciting and interesting events in every video. Every video has to be entertaining.

Comments and being at sea:
I love reading your comments. Most weeks Im able to read everyone. I cant reply to everybody but I do read and enjoy them. Keep them coming! There are times that It might seem I'm not on the internet for certain periods, this is normally when Im at sea on passage. While Im out on the Ocean I have completely no communications with the outside World.

■□■□■□■□■□■□■□■□■□■□■□■

Complete Written Recipe

Ingredients
¼ Cup of Oil
½ Cup Sugar for buns
2 cups sugar for Coconut Cream Sauce
6-7 cups of self raising flour
2 cups of warm water for buns
1 cup cold water for each coconut cream can
2 cans of coconut cream
4 tsp yeast
2 eggs

1) Mix the yeast, 2 cups warm water and ½ cup of sugar to activate the yeast and set for 10mins 
2) Crack eggs in a separate bowl, mix with oil and add the yeast/warm water mix to the bowl. Mix the wet ingredients well
3) Add most of the flour and mix with wooden spoon. Eventually you can use your hands to mix the dough together. Add the rest of the flour as well. 
4) Add oil to pan and hands then place in a warmed oven for 10mins to allow to rise. 
5) Pour 2 coconut cream cans, 2 cups cold water and 2 cups sugar to a separate bowl and mix. Put this aside to add later
6) Add flour to surface and bring out dough to roll out. 
7) Roll out the dough and brush with the coconut cream. Cut into strips and roll up into swirly buns. 
8) Warm oven to 180 degrees and place in the oven to bake for about 10-20mins. Once you see they turn golden brown, add coconut cream. 
9) Be sure to constantly brush over the top of the buns with coconut cream mix to give it a gloss. 
10) After 20-30mins, they should be ready. Be sure to bring out to cool then serve! 

Serves 6 people.

Transcript:
Around 1000 B.C., when the Fijian islands could
no longer support their growing populations the
people looked eastward to what is today the Kingdom 
of  Tonga.        
The limestone islands they found weren't as
diverse, nor as fertile as the volcanic ones they'd left,
so they brought with them the 
 domesticated animals and the food plants
they would need. 
The Kingdom of Tonga is comprised of a number 
of island groups.  The two most important are the 
Tongatapu group in the south and the Vava'u group in the north.  
Between them  lies the Ha'apai  group.

There are 170 islands in all, of which 40 are inhabited.
The southern group is dominated by the island of Tongatapu which
means ""sacred Tonga"" and is home to the king.
The earliest inhabitants of these island  established 
a hereditary monarchy.  Over the years, the kingdom 
splintered and royal bloodlines multiplied,  until,
In 1845,  the reins of power were once again gathered    
in the hands of one.  In 1875,  King George Tupou the 1st 
approved a constitution,  and since that time,  the country has had a 
constitutional monarchy. 
The pace of life is slow and easy in Nukalofa, the capital and only
large town in all of Tonga.  The streets and the market place
reflect the quality of life of the Tongan people. 
Fresh, healthy food, a diet based on fish and a low stress level 
that results from close family ties, have all contributed to one of the 
longest life spans on the globe.
Primary education has been mandatory since 1927 and 
King Tupou the 4th, the current monarch, was the first
Tongan ever to graduate from college.  
Although the Tongan economy receives outside help from
Britain and other countries, the land is fertile and most men
own land to grow the family's staples such as taro root, many
varieties of banana, yams, cassava root, various fruits -- and of course..

[한국어 정보]
시내 한가운데 있는 시장을 찾았다. 주로 농산물들을 사고파는 탈라마후 시장에는 낯선 채소와 먹을거리들이 가득했다. 통가 사람들은 원래 뿌리식물들을 많이 먹는다고 한다. 타로, 마니오께, 얌 같은 작물들은 ‘루’ 라는 잎채소와 함께 매일같이 밥상에 오른다. 굵은 나무처럼 생긴 ‘카페’ 라는 식물도 껍질을 벗겨 구워먹는다. 통가에는 예상했던 것보다 농산물이 훨씬 다양하고 풍부했다. 이건 뭐지? 아, 빵나무.“이걸 어떻게 먹어요?” “쪄서 먹어요.” 빵나무 열매는 통째로 쪄먹거나 가루로 과자를 만들어 먹기도 한다. 먹을거리가 사시사철 풍부해서인지 물건을 파는 사람도, 사는 사람도 느긋하기만 하다.

I visited the city in the middle of the market. After the market mainly de Lama buying and selling of agricultural products, the streets were full of food and are unfamiliar vegetables. Tonga people eat a lot of the original plant roots. Taro, to Mani Oh, yum crops such as rises in the dining table every day with ipchaeso called ""Lou"". Looking plant called 'cafe' like thick trees, bake and eat peeled. Tonga has a rich variety of agricultural products was much more than expected. What's this? Oh, breadfruit, ""Eat this, how?"" ""Steamed eat."" Breadfruit fruit and eat cookies made with flour is steamed and eaten whole. From the street selling food stuff whether it is also rich in four seasons, it is only the person to live comfortably.

Since I saw this movie as a teen ""the whale rider"" from new Zealand, swimming alongside these majestic creatures was always in the corner of my dreams. Tonga and Tongan people allowed me to take a dip... And encounter the whales.
I did it two times, and this video is about my second encounter, specifically with one mama and the calf who spent a very long time with us (we even took a lunch break and got back in the water with them). The calf was very playful and the mama calm and confident. The took a nap while with us and fed the baby. When we left on the boat, they followed us for long minutes, jumping many times. Pure emotions.
I hope this kind of encounter make people respect more the other animals with us on this planet.

INGREDIENTS

FOR THE STRAWBERRY COMPOTE
1 1/2 c. chopped strawberries
3 tbsp. sugar
1 tbsp. lemon juice
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract

FOR THE TOAST
1 loaf white bread, unsliced
2 Bananas, sliced
4 large eggs
1 c. heavy cream
1 tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
Vegetable oil, for frying
1 c. cinnamon sugar
sliced strawberries, for serving
Maple syrup, for serving

DIRECTIONS

1. Make strawberry compote: In a small skillet over medium heat, combine strawberries, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the strawberries begin to break down and the mixture has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and gently mash the compote with the back of a fork (or a potato masher).

2. Slice bread into 3 to 4 very thick pieces. Use a knife to create a slit in one side of the toast, then stuff banana slices into the toast. Repeat with remaining bread pieces and bananas.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. Dunk each stuffed sliced into the batter mixture, tossing to coat all sides.

3. Pour a 1/4” of vegetable oil into skillet and heat over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the battered bread and cook until crispy and golden all over, about 2 minutes per side.

4. Drain toast briefly on a wire rack. Pour cinnamon sugar into a large shallow bowl, then gently shake off excess oil from warm toast and toss in cinnamon sugar.

5. Garnish with fresh strawberries and serve with strawberry compote and maple syrup.

Fakapale is basically prize money, meant to be a gift to a dancer. As often is the case, the dance (tau’olunga) is performed by a dancer being honored for some event or milestone.

It is usual for a girl to start the tau’olunga dance, and then parents, cousins, family members and friends join in on the stage to put dollar bills on her oiled skin. Some will tuck them in the dancer’s costume, or slap the bills on their back, arms or legs. Then some will throw a huge wad of dollar bills in the air as a way of honoring her. I love to see those dollars floating in the air, hear the music and see everyone dancing.

KaTalkies, I hope you find this educational and entertaining at the same time.

The Royal car drives under a banner and crowds of up to six deep wave as it passes.

The Queen, in a different pale yellow outfit, accompanied by a member of the British military, carries a large wreath to a white stone memorial, gently places it down and takes a step back in a moment of quiet contemplation. The Queen walks towards two native people - presumably the Queen and King of Tonga. The two Queens walk side-by-side down a pathway, their entourages follow, whilst native ladies sit on both sides.
""The Royal Tongan feast on the Mala'e.""
Queen Elizabeth walks to a low table which is laden with food. The Queen, now sitting at the table, watches as local women prepare to serve the food. The table - shot from above - has a cooked pig sitting amongst other fresh produce and pairs of hands pick at the food. The Prince sits alongside his host at the table. The Prince glances to his right, towards the Queen as she interacts with a waitress - the guests sit waiting to commence their meal.","Queen's visit to Tonga, 1953.  Archive film 93232"

For the Pacific Islands the game of rugby has become the modern expression of their traditional warrior spirit. Their lightning fast, brutally physical, high risk style of rugby is legendary, making them every true fan’s favourite team wherever they play. But the reality behind the all-action sporting entertainment they provide is set against the unbelievable odds they go up against every time they play. Tonga arrives at the World Cup in France, its small talent pool having been culled from a total population that would barely fill one stadium, and given its limited resources, this fun loving band of brothers must train in public parks. But, during the tournament, Tonga pushes the boundaries of rugby to the limit on and off the pitch, nearly resulting in the greatest ever upset in professional sport and potentially changing the game forever. Although a Pacific Island team may not have won the World Cup just yet, in one important aspect the Islanders are victorious. Ask Jonny Wilkinson, Sir Clive Woodward or Serge Betsen where the greatest supply of raw talent comes from and the answer is unanimous - the tiny populations of the Pacific Islanders. Relatable to rugby fans and newcomers alike, and with contributions from the greats of rugby, Pacific Warriors is a unique, humorous and personal insight into two very contrasting worlds, all united in their passion for one sport.","Pacific Warriors"

►Check out my Istanbul travel guide: https://goo.gl/gRsk6W

Day 13: Istanbul to Rome on Turkish Airlines - On Day 13 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance, I first had the most insanely amazing doner kebab I’ve ever had, and then we went to the airport, enjoyed the Istanbul Turkish Airlines lounge, before flying with Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Rome.

00:53 Tarihi Karadeniz Döner - My friend Tuba from http://istanbulfood.com/ says this place serves the best doner kebab in Istanbul, and she’s no joking around. The first thing you notice when you arrive to Tarihi Karadeniz Döner is the biggest round of doner that you’ll likely ever see in your life - it’s absolutely incredibly beautiful. Many people order their doner kebab for takeaway, but they have some seating upstairs where you can grab a seat and enjoy your doner kebab immediately after its shaved off. I ordered a plate of doner kebab meat, which was absolutely awesome. The meat was shaved perfectly, so it was slightly crispy, yet juicy and flavorful all the way through. Then I also ordered the iskender kebab (İskender kebap), another Turkish food I had been longing to eat. The doner kebab meat is sliced off, then combined with tomato sauce, sheep butter, and yogurt. Finally, to wash down the doner, I also had a cup of ayran. Total price - 46 TL ($15.45)

7:19 Taxi to Istanbul Atatürk Airport - After the amazing doner kebab at Tarihi Karadeniz Döner, we then checked out of our hotel and jumped in a taxi to the airport. Price - 57 TL ($19.14)

8:13 Turkish Airlines Lounge - I haven’t been to too many lounges, but the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul is one of the most amazing airline lounges in the world. There was so much good food and so many drinks and beverage options. I was honestly pretty full after devouring all that doner kebab, but I did have a chance to try Turkish manti and then I went in for some salad.

12:05 Turkish Airlines Flight from Istanbul to Rome - We then caught our flight on Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Rome. Turkish Airlines is an amazing airline with great service, and I love how there’s a chef on board. For lunch I had the kebab and it was pretty good.

16:45 Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport - The flight from Istanbul to Rome didn’t take too long, and we arrive to Rome!

17:16 Bus to Termini Station - 5.90 EUR ($6.59) per person - To get from the airport to the center of Rome we took the bus, which dropped us off at Termini station. From Termini Station we took the Metro to Spagna station.

18:13 Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora - During out time in Rome, we stayed at Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora, located in a great location.

It was a bucket list trip and one of the most amazing experiences! Join me in exploring the island of Vava'u and then out to sea in order to search for whales and the chance to swim with them!

I give you tips and insights of what to know about Tonga and what you can expect from being on Vava'u and taking on this bucket list adventure.
