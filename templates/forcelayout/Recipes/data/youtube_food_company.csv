Our main competition – the Brands – produce most of their product in Asia because the labor is cheap and they can avoid regulation. No matter how the big brands may spin their story, it’s a calculated bottom line business decision to put profits-over-people and purposely outsources their clothing production overseas to exploit foreign workers and plunder their land. Their imported clothing is made cheaply, in both cost & quality, to meet price points or distribution needs, not to achieve great product. Then it’s halfway around the world to a distribution center and eventually a retail store where the consumer is charged a premium price. At Boathouse we started with one thought in mind about our product – how can we make our jackets and apparel perform for the athlete and improve the athlete’s experience? Not constrained by “margins” we were free to do just that – build great product that works better for athletic performance.","Why do we produce in the USA?

Among the various stars, aspirants, hangers-on, observers, and media folk are politically ambitious country icon Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson) and his fragile star protegée Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley); Tom (Keith Carradine), a self-absorbed rock star who woos lonely married gospel singer Linnea Reese (Lily Tomlin); Sueleen Gay (Gwen Welles), a talentless waitress painfully humiliated at her first singing gig; Albuquerque (Barbara Harris), a runaway wife with dreams of stardom; nightclub owner Lady Pearl (Barbara Baxley), who reminisces about ""those Kennedy boys""; single-minded groupie L.A. Joan (Shelley Duvall); vapid BBC commentator Opal (Geraldine Chaplin); and campaign guru John Triplette (Michael Murphy), who is trying to organize a concert rally for the unseen but always heard populist presidential candidate-cum-demagogue Hal Phillip Walker. Everything comes to a head during a climactic concert at Nashville's replica of the Parthenon temple, as the entertainment-hungry audience is momentarily woken out of its stupor by unexpected violence, only to be lulled into a restorative sing-along to ""It Don't Worry Me.""","Nashville"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH6jhXVAt2Y","President Donald Trump on Friday announced measures that he says will “dramatically lower” the price of prescription drugs for Americans.

The first action ends rebates to middlemen in Medicare and passes those rebates to Americans.

“Currently, drug companies provide large discounts on the price of prescription medicines, including nearly $40 billion in rebates to Medicare Part D plans last year alone,” Trump said at a press conference on Friday. “Yet often, middlemen stop those discounts from going to the patients.”

“Today’s action ends this injustice and requires that these discounts go directly to the people. These are the people that need it,” Trump said, adding that savings could amount to up to 30 or even 50 percent. “That doesn’t include lifesaving drugs like insulin, which will be even higher [in percentage of savings],” he said.

The second action, the Most Favored Nation rule, seeks to have Medicare observe and match the lowest price charged for the same drugs in other developed countries. Trump said this rule, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2021, will end “global freeloading” on American patients.

“Until now, Americans have often been charged more than twice as much for the exact same drug as other medically advanced countries. We would be having a drug—identical drug, same company—and we’d pay many times the price of what that drug would sell for in certain countries,” Trump said.

“In case after case, our citizens pay massively higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill, from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism aboard [abroad] with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive drugs to another country.

“And when I say the price is different, you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything—four times, five times different,” the president added.

Trump signaled his passion for standing up for American people against Big Pharma.

“For generations, the American people have been abused by Big Pharma and their army of lawyers, lobbyists, and bought-and-paid-for politicians. But I’ve [never] been loyal to the special interests; I have been loyal to our patients and our people that need drugs—prescription drugs—and devoted myself completely to fighting for the American people,” he said. “You see that. This is not an easy thing to do.”

Trump also announced that his administration will also be ending the 2006 Unapproved Drugs Initiative (UDI), which was designed to prevent the use of drugs not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The president said that the UDI has instead allowed drug manufacturers to exploit older generic drugs.

“In the past, drug companies have been allowed to identify certain very old generic drugs that have been widely available for decades and exploit a misguided program … to obtain market exclusivity on these medicines,” Trump said.

He said the UDI program “hasn’t been too good for the people that we’re supposed to benefit,” because drug companies have increased prices by 1,000 to 5,000 percent on certain drugs. Furthermore, certain important medicines have faced shortages under the program, he said.

“Together, these reforms will save American patients many, many billions of dollars every single year,” Trump said.

The Most Favored Nation rule would impact some 50 medications that account for the highest spending under Medicare’s “Part B” benefit for outpatient care.

Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that the normal market forces and negotiations that helps reduce cost in other parts of the healthcare system “just doesn’t exist in Part B,” which covers many cancer drugs and other medications delivered by infusion or injection in a doctor’s office.

“In Part B, American seniors and taxpayers pay whatever drug companies want to charge. And doctors also get paid a percentage add-on. So the higher the drug costs, the more they get paid, giving an overt incentive to prescribe higher-priced drugs and for manufacturers to increase those prices. And so it’s no wonder that American seniors are paying twice as much as what other countries are paying,” she said.

Verma said that Medicare spending for Part B drugs has increased by an average of 55 percent.

“Drug spending in Part B is responsible for over a third of the premiums that our seniors pay,” she said. “The bottom line is: Higher drug costs lead to higher premiums and higher copays. Doctors do well, drug companies do well, but patients pay more. This effort is going to save over $85 billion over seven years, and saving seniors over $28 billion as well.”

The pharmaceutical industry criticized Trump’s approach, saying it would give foreign governments the “upper hand” in deciding the value of medicines in the United States and vowed to fight it.","USA Voting Information Sent Out To Other Countries Via Cellular Connections. Germany Seized Servers!"

Investing in the Black community.

“Our community does need some help. We need a modernization of a banking infrastructure that gets to our community.” — Robert Smith
“We have given so much of this country, unequivocally, we deserve some special treatment. I don’t want welfare. I don’t need social programs to take care of everything. I want to see a targeted investment in communities.” — Killer Mike

”It’s how you give money here and give money there. How you give opportunity here and there. It’s not that we have to fight against each other. We don’t have to have a scrum in the street for a scratch of food. That’s not the country we live in.” — Ursula Burns

Education and student debt.
“In my life, I’m an engineer, I have never had an African-American science teacher my entire life. — Robert Smith

“I’m a mechanical engineer. I never had an African-American science or math teacher.” — Ursula Burns
“I would love to see more people become teachers in our neighborhoods. But if they have crushing student loan debt, that’s a travesty. The federal government can make changes about this.” — Robert Smith
Quotas and board diversity.
“If you spill dirt into the water, you get fined. If you lose a whole lot of money, you get fired. If you do not diversify your company inside, then there should be some negative consequences for that.” — Ursula Burns
“It’s only controversial when you talk about Black folk. There was no controversy on quotas when they were doing land giveaways in Middle America. There wasn’t a problem with quotas when the country was started.” — Killer Mike

The definition of a Black business.

“It’s either totally owned and operated by Black people and good to my community. Or it’s not owned by Black people, but it employs Black people, and it is good to my community. And lastly, the small businesses that came in later from immigrant populations that were moving into our city, even if they could not hire us, as long as they dealt fairly with our community.” — Killer Mike","Killer Mike and More Discuss Race and Corporate America"

However, 9 months later, the novel Coronavirus has claimed the lives of almost 200,000 Americans and caused staggering economic damage, while in South Korea, there were no significant lockdowns and, in an urbanized population of 51 million, only 344 lives have been lost. Where did we go wrong? As the presidential election nears, Americans are increasingly enraged by a lack of clear leadership, endemic political corruption and left to wonder how did the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world manage to fail so thoroughly in its response to a global pandemic? Academy Award-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney, directing with Ophelia Harutyunyan and Suzanne Hillinger, interrogates this question and its devastating implications in Totally Under Control. With damning testimony from public health officials and hard investigative reporting, Gibney exposes a system-wide collapse caused by a profound dereliction of Presidential leadership. It will be a generation before we know the full extent of the damage wrought by this pandemic, but Totally Under Control will stand as the definitive account of the Trump administration's incompetence, corruption and denial in the face of this global pandemic.","Totally Under Control"

President Donald Trump on Friday announced measures that he says will “dramatically lower” the price of prescription drugs for Americans.

The first action ends rebates to middlemen in Medicare and passes those rebates to Americans.

“Currently, drug companies provide large discounts on the price of prescription medicines, including nearly $40 billion in rebates to Medicare Part D plans last year alone,” Trump said at a press conference on Friday. “Yet often, middlemen stop those discounts from going to the patients.”

“Today’s action ends this injustice and requires that these discounts go directly to the people. These are the people that need it,” Trump said, adding that savings could amount to up to 30 or even 50 percent. “That doesn’t include lifesaving drugs like insulin, which will be even higher [in percentage of savings],” he said.

The second action, the Most Favored Nation rule, seeks to have Medicare observe and match the lowest price charged for the same drugs in other developed countries. Trump said this rule, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2021, will end “global freeloading” on American patients.

“Until now, Americans have often been charged more than twice as much for the exact same drug as other medically advanced countries. We would be having a drug—identical drug, same company—and we’d pay many times the price of what that drug would sell for in certain countries,” Trump said.

“In case after case, our citizens pay massively higher prices than other nations pay for the same exact pill, from the same factory, effectively subsidizing socialism aboard [abroad] with skyrocketing prices at home. So we would spend tremendous amounts of money in order to provide inexpensive drugs to another country.

“And when I say the price is different, you can see some examples where the price is beyond anything—four times, five times different,” the president added.

Trump signaled his passion for standing up for American people against Big Pharma.

“For generations, the American people have been abused by Big Pharma and their army of lawyers, lobbyists, and bought-and-paid-for politicians. But I’ve [never] been loyal to the special interests; I have been loyal to our patients and our people that need drugs—prescription drugs—and devoted myself completely to fighting for the American people,” he said. “You see that. This is not an easy thing to do.”

Trump also announced that his administration will also be ending the 2006 Unapproved Drugs Initiative (UDI), which was designed to prevent the use of drugs not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The president said that the UDI has instead allowed drug manufacturers to exploit older generic drugs.

“In the past, drug companies have been allowed to identify certain very old generic drugs that have been widely available for decades and exploit a misguided program … to obtain market exclusivity on these medicines,” Trump said.

He said the UDI program “hasn’t been too good for the people that we’re supposed to benefit,” because drug companies have increased prices by 1,000 to 5,000 percent on certain drugs. Furthermore, certain important medicines have faced shortages under the program, he said.

“Together, these reforms will save American patients many, many billions of dollars every single year,” Trump said.

The Most Favored Nation rule would impact some 50 medications that account for the highest spending under Medicare’s “Part B” benefit for outpatient care.

Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that the normal market forces and negotiations that helps reduce cost in other parts of the healthcare system “just doesn’t exist in Part B,” which covers many cancer drugs and other medications delivered by infusion or injection in a doctor’s office.

“In Part B, American seniors and taxpayers pay whatever drug companies want to charge. And doctors also get paid a percentage add-on. So the higher the drug costs, the more they get paid, giving an overt incentive to prescribe higher-priced drugs and for manufacturers to increase those prices. And so it’s no wonder that American seniors are paying twice as much as what other countries are paying,” she said.

Verma said that Medicare spending for Part B drugs has increased by an average of 55 percent.

“Drug spending in Part B is responsible for over a third of the premiums that our seniors pay,” she said. “The bottom line is: Higher drug costs lead to higher premiums and higher copays. Doctors do well, drug companies do well, but patients pay more. This effort is going to save over $85 billion over seven years, and saving seniors over $28 billion as well.”

The pharmaceutical industry criticized Trump’s approach, saying it would give foreign governments the “upper hand” in deciding the value of medicines in the United States and vowed to fight it.","“STOP THE STEAL” RALLIES ACROSS AMERICA MARCH & SING & PRAY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP !!!"

As a staff photographer for the San Antonio Express-News, William Luther may have done more to help hungry Americans this Thanksgiving than anyone will ever really know. ""We were hearing from politicians that they were calling each other saying, Have you seen the picture?"" he told correspondent Lee Cowan.  ""And they didnt have to describe it.  They already knew what  Did you see the picture?""The picture hes talking about is this drone shot taken back on April 9, high above some ten thousand people, their cars parked bumper-to-bumper in a vast San Antonio parking lot, waiting for food. The image went viral.  ""I think it really helped put clarity on something that was really difficult for people to understand,"" Luther said. If there was any doubt that COVID has deepened Americas hunger crisis, that picture dispelled it. Folks at the San Antonio Food Bank, as well as its hundreds of volunteers like Paul Drummond, havent seen the lines stop yet. ""Its the kind of thing that you keep thinking its gonna be over, and not only is it not over, the need just grows, Drummond said.

https://thegrubwire.com/five-guys-fra...

#franchise #fiveguys #franchising

In 1986, Jerry Murrell came up with a unique proposition for his sons: “The boys could go to college, or he could use their education money to start a restaurant.” Jerry was concerned with keeping the family together and had the idea that they would run this business together.

It didn’t take much convincing to get the boys to start a business in lieu of going to college. In 1986, the first Five Guys was opened in Arlington, Virginia for a little less than $70,000. It was in the middle of nowhere, there was no parking and no place for customers to sit and eat.

Original Five Guys Location in Arlington, Virginia
Original Five Guys Location in Arlington, Virginia
Eventually, they opened a few more restaurants, but their biggest decision came in 2002. By then there were five restaurants, all in Northern Virginia. Murrell was against franchising, but his sons really started pushing for it. Around that time the family met Mark Mosely, former Washington Redskin, and that relationship led to the first franchisee. From there, word spread quickly and Five Guys was on to becoming the largest “better burger” franchise in the US.

Today, there are over 1,300 locations, and the franchise has added around ~50 stores a year for the last few years.

So you want to be a part of the largest and fastest growing “Better Burger” chain in Five guys but wondering what it costs? We reviewed the franchise disclosure document and found that the typical restaurant is 2,000 to 3,000 square feet, and the estimated initial investment cost was between $306,200 and $641,250. This includes an initial franchise fee of $25,000 for the first location and $75,000 for each location thereafter.

How Much Money Can you Make as a Five Guys Franchisee?
So you have shelled out somewhere between $300,000 to $600,000 (let’s call it $450,000 for our math) then how much money can you expect to make? Well, according to the FDD and multiple other reports, the average Five Guys location does around $1,320,000 in sales and roughly 18% EBITDA margins. That equates to roughly $237,000 in profits per location.

So is $237,000 a good return? Well, on a $450,000 build out cost that equates to a 53% return on capital. These margins are much higher than many other restaurant investments, but you will need to decide if the size and return on this investment is right for you.

Five Guys Estimated Initial Investment Costs
As mentioned, the estimated initial investment cost for a Five Guys location ranges $306,000 to $641,000. Here is how those costs break down:

Initial Franchise Fee: $25,000 (Initial Term 10 Years)
Development Fee: $50,000 per restaurant ($125,000 in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico)
Leasehold Improvements: $100,000 to $300,000
Lease Payments: $7,500 to $20,000
Equipment: $55,000 to $105,000
Signage: $6,000 to $20,000
Initial Inventory: $10,000 to $15,000
Architectural/Engineering: $7,000 to $25,000
Electronic Cash Register: $15,000 to $25,000
Facsimile Machine: $350 to $500
Travel, lodging for initial training: $100 to $5,000
Business Supplies: $4,000 to $8,500
Business Licenses and Permits: $5,000 to $15,000
Delivery and Catering Expenses: $0 to $1,000
Insurance Deposits and Premiums: $750 to $1,250
Additional Funds for first 3 Months: $20,000 to $25,000
Total: $306,200 to $641,250
Royalties, Advertising and Other Ongoing Fees
Like other franchises, the major costs paid back to the franchise system include royalties and advertising costs. Here is the breakdown of those ongoing expenses:

Royalty Fee: 6% of Gross Sales (8% if located in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico)
Creative Fund: Up to 2% of Gross Sales (2% currently)
Local Advertising: Not less than 2% of Gross Sales
Cooperative Advertising: Max of 1.5% of Gross Sales (credited to local advertising)","How Much Money Five Guys Franchise Owners Make - Five Guys Franchise Cost #franchise"

AstraZeneca announced today that late-stage trial shows its Covid-19 vaccine with Oxford University was up to 90-percent effective in preventing the disease becoming the third major drug company, after Pfizer and Moderna, to report late-stage results for its potential COVID-19 vaccine.
Against this backdrop, the U.S. top vaccine official said the first Americans could be vaccinated in a matter of weeks.
The South Korean government continues its efforts to have vaccines ready for its citizens as early as possible.
Choi Won-jong with the details.
The White House vaccine chief Dr. Moncef Slaoui says... the first Americans could receive a COVID-19 vaccine... as early as the second week of December.
Speaking in an interview with CNN on Sunday, he said the plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunization sites within 24 hours of approval... so on the 11th or 12th of December, the first people will be immunized across the United States.
He said pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its partner BioNTech had submitted their application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization.
If it gets approval from FDA vaccine advisory committee on December 10th, the vaccine could be distributed the next day.
However, it could take until May next year to achieve ""true herd community"" with 70 percent of the population vaccinated.
In South Korea, the government is gearing up to get enough vaccines prepared.
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Monday the nation will secure enough COVID-19 vaccines at the right time.
Due to the high interest in vaccine readiness, the government will soon report the progress to the public.
Health authorities currently plan to purchase 10 million batches through the global vaccine supply platform, COVAX facility, and 20 million from individual vaccine companies.
The Prime Minister urged the results of the negotiations to be reported to the public transparently.
In the UK, AstraZeneca announced their successful COVID-19 vaccine results with an average of around 70-percent efficacy, and the possibility that perfecting the dosage would give 90% protection.
In the company's statement on Monday, it confirmed the efficacy and safety of the vaccines.
British health authorities welcomed called the development ""fantastic news"".

Some of the UK's biggest food companies have attacked a plan that could see all online junk food advertising banned to tackle childhood obesity.  In a letter to the prime minister, bosses of firms including Britvic, Kellogg's and Mars said they supported government efforts to tackle obesity. But they said the plans were ""disproportionate"" and lacked evidence.  The government has said it is determined to help children and families make ""healthier choices"". It originally planned to ban online adverts and TV commercials for unhealthy foods that appeared before 9pm, but strengthened this in November. The prime minister is said to have changed course after being hospitalised with Covid-19, something he links to being overweight.  The proposal, which is still under consultation, could usher in some of the toughest digital marketing restrictions in the world by the end of 2022. Firms would not be able to promote foods high in fat, salt or sugar in Facebook ads, paid search results on Google, text promotions and posts on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. But the letter, which has been signed by 800 food and drink manufacturers and 3,000 UK brands, says food companies have not been given enough time to submit detailed objections.  ""The UK government is quite correctly committed to evidence-based policy making. However, the evidence base underpinning these proposals is lacking in both detail and efficacy,"" it says. ""Additionally, there is still no agreed definition of which foods the government is including in these proposals.  ""They are so broad they even capture family favourites from chocolate to peanut butter to sausage rolls."" The government estimates children aged under 16 were exposed to 15 billion junk food adverts online in 2019, versus 700 million two years earlier. But in the letter, firms said advertisers could use sophisticated online tools to aim their advertisements at adult audiences, not children.  It also voiced concern about plans to police how producers described their products on their own websites and social media channels, saying this would disproportionately impact smaller businesses - which make up 96% of the industry. ""Is it really the government's intention that a local wedding cake business, for example, would not be able to share product details on its Instagram account in order to grow its sales?"" the letter said.  The food and drink industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, worth more than £28bn to the economy and employing almost 500,000 people. Unveiling plans for the ban earlier this month, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I am determined to help parents, children and families in the UK make healthier choices about what they eat. ""We know children spend more time online. Parents want to be reassured they are not being exposed to adverts promoting unhealthy foods, which can affect habits for life.""
