Thirty years of rising living standards have left Qatar with an epidemic of obese children. Now doctors are trying to tighten belts and stem the tide on a major health problem that could have far reaching consequences.

At the beginning I was fine, until I was in the third year at primary school. Then the Gulf tummy started to grow explains Moaz, who suffered from obesity all through his childhood. A sharp rise in economic affluence, increasingly westernized diets and low exercise rates has lead to an explosion in the country's levels of obesity. 40% of Qataris are now obese and 20% suffer from diabetes, with 75% of diabetics under 45 years of age. As Dr Taheri explains, the effects could be far reaching. ""They are going to be affected at a very young age with heart disease, problems with cancer, dementia, things that are going to affect the nation in the long term."" Doctors like Taheri are hoping that a strict program of prevention, enforcing healthy diets and exercise regimes upon the nation's schoolchildren will be enough to limit the impact.

🔥America: Also a country in the list of countries with high rates of obesity in the world. Many people say that up to 2 out of 3 Americans are being overweight or obese. 
Mexico: People are showing signs of being overweight and obese about 32.8%.

-People who love to eat fast food, nutritious foods, high in energy, Prefer to eat fatty foods, hate to eat green vegetables and fruits, eat a lot of sweets, use alcohol, carbonated drinks.","Join me on the 28 day weight loss challenge"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4d4H92QnS0","The 10 Fattest countries in the World. For more detail see below..

1. Nauru
Obesity has long been a major health concern for the citizens of Nauru. According to statistics revealed by the World Health Organization, nearly 94.5% of the country’s citizens are overweight, and 71.7% of its people are outright obese – the highest in the world.
Nearly ninety percent of the land area in the country is said to be packed full of phosphate deposits, which has made them inarable. For this reason, the people of Nauru rely on importing processed foods that are high in both sugar and fat as they have very little arable land. With their diet being so full of fat and sugar, it is no surprise that Nauru is the fattest country in the world.

2. USA
As per data acquired in September 2015, obesity rates are higher than 35% in Mississippi, West Virginia and Arkansas. As for the rest of the states, 22 states have over 30% obese indviduals, 45 states are over 25% with the rest being above 20%. On the whole, it is believed that two out of every three Americans is either overweight or obese.
Research suggests that nearly 120,000 preventable deaths occur in the United States on a yearly  basis due to obesity. With that, an obese person is known to spend about $1,429 in medical expenses each year.

3. Venezuela
As per the statistics revealed by the World Health Organization, nearly 67.5% of Venezuelans over 20 years of age are overweight. The reason behind Venezuelans being obese is simple – most of them cannot find enough to eat. The country experiences rigid price controls and a lack of U.S. dollars makes it just about impossible for necessary supplies to even be imported by the country’s largest food company known as Empresas Polar SA. For this reason, even basic necessities like flour and milk are in short supply. Such conditions make it hard for the average Venezuelan to have balanced meals. Instead, they eat fried foods excessively together with goods prepared using flour to fill up. 

4. Bahrain
According the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated 66% of Bahrain’s adult population has major weight related issues. As with other Arab countries, females are more prone to obesity with about 42.4% of girls between the ages 12 and 17 being obese and 29.9% of boys in the same age range being obese.

5. Libya
Women in the Arab world are commonly overweight or obese. The reason for this is simple – cultural norms in the Arab world do not encourage women’s mobility. It is for this reason that women in countries like Libya live extremely sedentary lives and binge eat, thereby leaving Libyan women at high risk of obesity.

6. UAE
UAE happens to be a fairly rich and prosperous country where a majority of people get to enjoy a lavish life. However, the outcomes of living a luxurious lifestyle aren’t always great. It is for this particular reason that nearly 47.5% of UAE citizens are overweight with a BMI of between 25 and 30. On the other hand, a full 13% of its citizens are outright obese.

7. Kuwait
Nearly 50% of all women in Kuwait are obese, with about 42.8% of its entire population being extremely obese. The reason why obesity is so prevalent in Kuwait is because the people there get to enjoy an extremely affluent lifestyle. Together with a fascination with fried foods and red meat, the sort of life that Kuwaiti citizens live adds to the risk of obesity.

8. Belize
It isn’t just its border that Belize shares with Mexico, the two countries have a common weight issue as well!
Nearly 34.9% of the population of Belize is obese. Because of this high statistic, Belizeans are being urged by the Ministry of Health to eat more ground foods and whole grain so as to reduce blood sugar levels and control the onset of obesity. The Ministry of Health has also suggested reduced intake of fats, salt and sugar as their consumption only leads to even more health related issues together with obesity.

9. Mexico
Mexico is known to have an obesity rate of nearly 32.8%. Food standards in the country have dropped rather quickly ever since processed foods were introduced in the 1980s. Mexico has actually declared obesity a national health issue as its people continue to prefer low-cost meals that are high in sugar, fat, salt and calories over a balanced and nutritious diet. With the passage of time, it is becoming all the more necessary for food regulation authorities to put up regulations and offer recommendations over good consumption.

10. Malta
Malta leads the whole of the EU in having the highest rates of overweight and obese individuals. It is believed that around 21.1% of all Maltese citizens are either overweight or obese, thereby making it one of the fattest countries in the world.","The 10 Fattest Countries in the World"

The very first McDonald's restaurant appeared in Kuwait on a U.S. military base set up to support the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, the industry has rapidly expanded — there are now hundreds of U.S. fast food restaurants in Kuwait and as a result, the country has become one of the most obese nations on the planet. 

""The begining of fast food, I would say it is part of the Americanization of the culture here."" Dr. Mohsen Bagnied, a professor at the American University of Kuwait told VICE News. Now, Kuwait has roughly double the percentage of diabetic adults than the U.S. 

​The fast food industry isn't just operating in the Middle East. American Fast food brands populate more than 100 countries around the world, occupying six continents. And the global fast food industry is projected to be worth over $600 billion by 2019. 

VICE's Gianna Toboni travels to Kuwait to witness the health effects on a country deep in the throes of an unlikely obsession with U.S. fast food.

The show continued for another 16 seasons, raking in millions, before quietly disappearing in 2016. So whatever became of the winners? Here's what they look like now.
 
When Ryan Benson joined the first season of The Biggest Loser, he weighed over 300 pounds. And after five grueling months of extreme workouts and dietary restrictions, he clocked in at just 208 pounds. But once the cameras stopped rolling, Benson started slipping back into old habits almost immediately. He told Business Insider,

""In my mind I just thought I've been training so hard I want to eat something I craved for a few months, a burger, fries, some ribs. That was one of the things that propelled me to the finish line."" 

""I just slipped back into my old habits really quick within the next year or two, and within about four or five years, I'd put back on all the weight.""

It turned out Benson had gained back the weight he lost, plus some. He told Inside Edition in 2017 that he was once again dieting to lose the weight.

""I'm still losing weight slowly and steady, and I don't plan on ever changing.""

Today, his Instagram says that he's doing his best to live a healthy, plant-based life.

Matt Hoover debuted on Season 2 weighing 339 pounds. And by the time we was crowned the second-ever winner, he'd lost 157 pounds. 

But unbeknownst to viewers at the time, Hoover and third place winner Suzy Preston had fallen in love on the show. According to People, the couple said ""I do"" in 2006 and have since welcomed two sons.

By 2010, Hoover had regained some weight, revealing to NBC News Chicago that he weighed 237 pounds. Preston, too, had gained back over 40 pounds. In 2011, the couple confessed via YouTube that they feel guilty for not maintaining their weight loss, but recent pics of the family prove they're doing great together.  Keep watching to see What the winners of The Biggest Loser look like now!

Overweight is most commonly measured using the body mass index (BMI) scale. BMI values are used to define whether an individual is considered to be underweight, healthy, overweight or obese. A BMI greater than 25.0 is defined as overweight.

Fundamentally, obesity results from people consuming more calories than their bodies burn, but it's a far more complex problem than that.

1. Mustang in a hurry.  He gets to the next intersection and makes a U-turn, then drives slow (not shown)

2. Oblivious Lane change. no signal no look to see if anyone is close in the lane.  I am doing about 80mph and he is in the middle lane doing about 45mph when he just decides to move into the left lane for no reason at all.

3. SUV in a hurry almost misses exit cause he didn't want to slow down and get behind the other car.  I was doing about 80 mph, when he blew by me (not shown)

4. Motor Cycle madness on the freeway.  1 guy doing a wheelie when his buddy comes up on his right side and grabs is butt.  He almost looses it at about 70mph.

The fatness level is measured using 3 indices: BMI (Body Mass Index), Obesity rate and overweight rate of countries. We use the popular countryball series where the length of the ball corresponds with the unit size of BMI. 

Visualization note: The countryballs have same height but are linearly scaled across their width by their BMI. i.e. A Countryball with a BMI of 30 would be 1.5X the width of a Countryball with a BMI of 20. 

Flag note for Poland: Polandball is drawn this way as a rule of Countryball (upside down)! That is also why Indoball has a rice hat.

Data was compiled with information from the Global Health Observatory data repository, last updates in 2017.

It averages the data from both sexes, ages 18 and up, and classifies obesity as having a BMI (body max index) of 30 or more.

BMI calculates a person's mass (weight) divided by the square of their height. An individual with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or more is considered overweight. An individual with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more is considered obese.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YICjMpUyJak","This Public Service Announcement (PSA) features an overweight teenage boy eating a fast food burger in front of the television set. Facts about obesity are displayed in simple text with the sound of chewing and slurping in the background. The text says, ""Children from Ages 5-19 are most affected by Obesity,"" and ""The main reason for childhood obesity is eating while watching television or doing homework."" The boy finishes his soft drink and the message appears, ""Treat Your Body Right"". The PSA was made by Suhaila Al-Salem, a board member, and active leader within the civil society organization, Women Cultural Social Society. She wishes to educate both parents and youth about health complications caused by childhood obesity, a relatively new problem in Kuwait.

In addition to Suhaila's activism, she organizes women's health initiatives through Women Cultural Society, and activities for women to gain business and networking skills to open their own businesses in Kuwait.
She is the primary contact for the Kuwait NGO Film Club that formed after a two-week workshop led by Barefoot Workshops at the Radisson SAS in Kuwait. She plans to continue creating her own PSA's and facilitating monthly meeting for the club. Please contact Suhaila if you would like to join the Kuwait NGO Film Club, or if you would like to broadcast the groups PSA's on regional networks in The Middle East.

Background:

This Public Service Announcement (PSA) was produced locally in Kuwait City, Kuwait as part of a media workshop, entitled ""Media, Activism and Democracy,"" led by Barefoot Workshops in partnership with The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI). Thirteen participants from seven organizations, mostly women and youth, learned how to write, shoot, produce and edit, thirty-second noncommercial videos (Public Service Announcements), to raise awareness about social issues. The goal of the workshops was to increase discussion, debate and civic participation in the Middle East. 

The PSAs are available in Arabic and English to broadcasters and other organizations that wish to distribute them ""rights-free"" on television and/or the Internet.

Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their traditional cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:
#Top10obesecountry #Top10obese2020 
Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtrtO3_sb44","This Public Service Announcement (PSA) displays facts about health complications that can result from obesity between images of a red balloon getting pumped with air- bigger and bigger until it fills the whole frame. ""45% of people in Kuwait between the ages of 6-19 are overweight,"" the text says."" Obesity inhibits activity in the area of the brain affecting language, memory, vision and speech,"" A final WARNING sign appears with more facts about the side affects of obesity: ""Obesity can cause high blood pressure, insomnia, depression, and low self-esteem."" The sound of a balloon popping over this final message is meant to startle and wake up the audience to the dangers of early obesity.

This video was created by Suhaila Al-Salem, a board member and active leader within the civil society organization, Women Cultural Social Society. She wishes to educate both parents and youth about possible health complications caused by childhood obesity, a relatively new problem in Kuwait. Suhaila would like to create a movement of Kuwaitis committed to tackling the issue of childhood obesity, and to build a widespread public awareness campaigns through this and other Public Service Announcements. She also wishes to call parents attention to bad habits formed by their children at an early age, such as eating while watching television or playing video games, neglecting to exercise, and over-consuming fast foods, which result in weight gain and impaired health.

In addition to Suhaila's activism, she organizes women's health initiatives through Women Cultural Society, and activities for women to gain business and networking skills to open their own businesses in Kuwait.

She is the primary contact for the Kuwait NGO Film Club that formed after a two-week workshop led by Barefoot Workshops at the Radisson SAS in Kuwait. She plans to continue creating her own PSA's and facilitating monthly meeting for the club. Please contact Suhaila if you would like to join the Kuwait NGO Film Club, or if you would like to broadcast the groups PSAs on regional networks in The Middle East.

Background:
This Public Service Announcement (PSA) was produced locally in Kuwait City, Kuwait as part of a media workshop, entitled ""Media, Activism and Democracy,"" led by Barefoot Workshops in partnership with The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI). Thirteen participants from seven organizations, mostly women and youth, learned how to write, shoot, produce and edit, thirty-second noncommercial videos (Public Service Announcements), to raise awareness about social issues. The goal of the workshops was to increase discussion, debate and civic participation in the Middle East. The PSAs are available in Arabic and English to broadcasters and other organizations that wish to distribute them ""rights-free"" on television and/or the Internet.

Music and sound design provided by Nabeel Bahy (of Kuwait).

Corrina counts down the 10 worst foods you could eat in terms of weight gain and obesity. Chances are if you eat an average American diet, you ate at least three of these this week.  These are the foods that will make you fat. 

In a fast food nation, eating #healthy food becomes difficult to do. Yet a poor diet contributes to low energy, obesity, stress, health problems and high medical bills. 

If you eat better, you will feel better and this video discusses some of the foods you should avoid. Fitness, health and wellness depend on good nutrition.

Thirty years of rising living standards have left Qatar with an epidemic of obese children. Now doctors are trying to tighten belts and stem the tide on a major health problem that could have far reaching consequences.

At the beginning I was fine, until I was in the third year at primary school. Then the Gulf tummy started to grow explains Moaz, who suffered from obesity all through his childhood. A sharp rise in economic affluence, increasingly westernized diets and low exercise rates has lead to an explosion in the country's levels of obesity. 40% of Qataris are now obese and 20% suffer from diabetes, with 75% of diabetics under 45 years of age. As Dr Taheri explains, the effects could be far reaching. ""They are going to be affected at a very young age with heart disease, problems with cancer, dementia, things that are going to affect the nation in the long term."" Doctors like Taheri are hoping that a strict program of prevention, enforcing healthy diets and exercise regimes upon the nation's schoolchildren will be enough to limit the impact.

I think the natural reaction to the suggestion of the power of marketing is that “I’m too smart to fall for that; marketing works on other people, but I can see through it.” But that’s what everyone thinks! For a splash of cold water to shake us all out of this delusion, I next bring you some data: The Role of Food Advertisements in the Obesity Epidemic (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-r...).

This is the 7th in an 11-video series. The first several are: 
• The Role of Diet vs. Exercise in the Obesity Epidemic (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-r...)

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfjnJz2M30","A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.

Hover over a country for details.
In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Pregnant women that are obese may suffer from complications that can lead to health problems for the mother or child. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.

Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their tradition cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:

Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)
Tonga (Average BMI: 31.9)
Samoa (Average BMI: 31.7)
Kuwait (Average BMI: 30)
Saint Kitts and Nevis (Average BMI: 29.7)
Saint Lucia (Average BMI: 29.6)
Kiribati (Average BMI: 29.6)
Palau (Average BMI: 29.4)
Micronesia (Average BMI: 29.4)
Tuvalu (Average BMI: 29.3)

Pharmacists should promote healthy living therefore it’s their duty to help prevent and manage obesity.  Obesity is a rising issue and an economical burden on the NHS. The NHS will spend £50 million by 2050 to continue addressing obesity issues. Pharmacists assist via referring patients to Doctors/Dieticians, weight management services held at the pharmacy, BMI screening (BMI of 30+ = obese) (MNT, 2004), discussions on drug therapies, motivational interviewing and supporting patients (Bonner, 2015). Pharmacists could also discuss the risk factors associated with obesity such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes in order to relay to the patient the importance of a healthy weight (Awad A, Waheedi M, 2012).

Because the island is so small, a single tourist resort, fast-food chain, or trade deal has a much more profound effect on society than it would, say, in India.

6. Niue: 50%
Nine of the world's ten most obese countries are in the Pacific.

7. Tonga: 48.32%
Up to 40% of the Tongan population has type 2 diabetes.

8. Samoa: 47.3%
In the 1950s, U.S. poultry farms began dumping unwanted fatty turkey tails into markets in Samoa, where they soon became a Samoan favorite.

9. Kiribati: 46%
Globalization introduced processed and calorie-dense food, such as Spam and corned beef.

10. Kuwait: 37.9
The very first McDonald’s restaurant in Kuwait appeared on a U.S. military base during the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, obesity rates have skyrocketed.

There are many reasons for the high obesity rates in Kuwait. Some of them are:
1. The introduction of fast foods and Western restaurant chains and the rise in their numbers in Kuwait. People in Kuwait are eating out often, and that includes children. They are being exposed to fatty restaurant foods at a very young age. These restaurants use lots of fat, sugar, and sodium in their meals mainly to make the food taste good. The type of fat used in usually the harmful type -- saturated and trans fats. These fats clog up the arteries and contribute to heart disease. We find saturated fats in animals and animal products, such as red meat, butter, full cream milk, and other dairy products. Trans fats are also known as hydrogenated fats, and are usually solidified vegetable oils. These are even more harmful than saturated fats and should be completely avoided. They are found in many of the pastries and ready-baked goods that we buy in the market and bakeries, margarine, biscuits, ghee, etc.","Obesity in Kuwait: My Take"

It has been a very productive ride for Mexico during the 24 year NAFTA agreement. For example, its GDP per capita jumped up over 20 percent.

But there have been some downsides too. Especially in the way Mexicans consume and eat.

Correspondent Lara Rodriguez takes a closer look at the post-NAFTA eating habits and food-related illnesses in Mexico.

We're sure no one likes being obese so why are so many people obese? It could be because of an inactive lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits or even due to genetic and medical factors beyond their control.

But obesity isn't just a condition; it's a disease. In fact, it is the root cause of many other diseases. Diabetes, cancers, heart diseases...are all caused largely due to obesity.

We want to put a stop to all of it. We want to fight it at the root by taking the orange pledge...because we believe; a simple move can make a difference.

Sixty-five percent of the world's population lives in countries where being overweight or obese accounts for higher mortality than being underweight or malnourished. In the United Kingdom, obesity is a rapidly growing issue, showing no signs of slowing down. The Foresight Report, conducted by the UK government, concluded that half the population could be obese by 2050, while independent organizations, such as the National Obesity Forum, predict that number will be higher. The reports estimate that the obese population could cost the Nation Health Service (NHS) as much as 10 billion British pounds ($16 billion) by 2050. This slideshow examines the growing debate as to the causes of obesity. And while pressure mounts to find a resolution, London is slowly moving towards a healthier lifestyle. Other areas of the UK, however, tell a much different story.

Pets have long been used as status symbols the world over, but citizens of the Gulf take the prize when it comes to keeping the most exotic, controversial species—most commonly, ""big cat"" cubs.

International law governing Kuwait and other Gulf states forbids the import and sale of wild animals, yet the sight of supercars being driven around with a cheetah in the front seat is starting to become commonplace on Arab Instagram feeds.

Although there are legal ways to bring an animal into Kuwait, paying people off along the way is easier. Lion, cheetah, and tiger cubs are in the highest demand, fetching up to $15,000 each through black market agents. More often than not, the owners have little idea how to care for these creatures, which have no history of domestication and quickly become unmanageable—even lethal—once they're fully grown.

In Big Cats of the Gulf, VICE investigates the area's flourishing trade in animal trafficking and how it impacts the depleting wildcat populations of Central and East Africa. We gain exclusive access to Kuwait's biggest Instagram star of the big cat phenomenon and hear first-hand of the deadly consequences of the business—both for the animals and their owners.

The very first McDonald's restaurant appeared in Kuwait on a U.S. military base set up to support the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, the industry has rapidly expanded — there are now hundreds of U.S. fast food restaurants in Kuwait and as a result, the country has become one of the most obese nations on the planet. 

""The begining of fast food, I would say it is part of the Americanization of the culture here."" Dr. Mohsen Bagnied, a professor at the American University of Kuwait told VICE News. Now, Kuwait has roughly double the percentage of diabetic adults than the U.S. 

​The fast food industry isn't just operating in the Middle East. American Fast food brands populate more than 100 countries around the world, occupying six continents. And the global fast food industry is projected to be worth over $600 billion by 2019. 

VICE's Gianna Toboni travels to Kuwait to witness the health effects on a country deep in the throes of an unlikely obsession with U.S. fast food.

Italy scrambles to contain coronavirus outbreak after admitting hospital mess-up
By Angela Dewan, Sharon Braithwaite and Nicola Ruotolo, CNN

Updated 1728 GMT (0128 HKT) February 25, 202
Milan, Italy (CNN)Italian authorities were on the defensive Tuesday as they faced tough questions over the country's handling of the novel coronavirus, which is rapidly spreading across the country's northern regions.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has tried to allay fears that the central government has no control over the affected regions after he was forced to admit that a hospital in the northern town of Codogno had mishandled the region's first coronavirus case and had contributed to the deadly virus' spread.
Italy now has the highest number of coronavirus infections outside Asia, as 54 new cases were detected in the country's north overnight, bringing the total to 283, the Italian civil protection agency said Tuesday.
The cases are heavily concentrated in the region of Lombardy where 212 infections have been confirmed. Seven people have so far died from the virus in the country.
&quot;Our health system is excellent, our precautionary measures are of the utmost rigor and we trust that, by virtue of the combined provisions ... we will promote a containment effect,&quot; Conte told reporters on Tuesday.
--------------------------------------
UAE halts all Iran flights over coronavirus outbreak
Flight ban comes after Kuwait and Bahrain report coronavirus cases in people returning from Iran.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has suspended all flights to and from Iran for at least a week over the outbreak of the new coronavirus after its spread was announced across multiple Middle East nations from the Islamic Republic.

The UAE, home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, remains a key international transit route for Iran's 80 million people.

Military hospital launches 5G teleconsultation to support Wuhan's epidemic battle
Source: Xinhua| 2020-02-10 21:09:22|Editor: huaxia
BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital carried out 5G teleconsultation services Sunday with Huoshenshan Hospital, a recently built makeshift hospital in Wuhan, to battle the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak.

The teleconsultation also marks the launching of the teleconsultation system between the two hospitals.

Supported by the 5G network, the system enables doctors in Beijing to establish real-time communications with those in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in central China's Hubei Province.

Experts of the Chinese PLA General Hospital will be kept on standby to offer high-quality medical services to patients in Wuhan, the hospital said.
-----------------------
5G holds an agenda for total control. It is stated that when it is introduced in 2020, it can be used for “anything, anywhere, anytime in an unlimited manner”. I am all for digital progress but not at the expense of having an adverse impact on human and environmental health.

It is not my intention to go into the merits that 5G violates human rights and informed consent. My interest, as a family doctor and a representative of the people, is society’s well-being.

We live in a society whose quality of life and health is being drastically affected by air, water and land pollutants, which are man induced.

One such pollutant, which we do take for granted, is the accumulation of artificial electromagnetic fields that at times reach the thresholds of an electrosmog. It is an established fact that electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has increased by tenfold on the top of the background, natural EMR. 

I often ask myself: are we playing Russian roulette each time we use our cellular phone? For US Attorney Jimmy Gonzalez it definitely was the case.

He used to hold his cellular phone with his left hand on the left side of his ear and he developed a tumour in his left hand, a gliobastoma on the left side of his head and an aortic tumour because he held the cellular phone inside his jacket pocket.

Who knows, I may have developed prostate cancer early in life not only because I am genetically predisposed but because I used to hold my cellular phone in my trousers pocket or on my car seat very close to me while driving. Non-native EMR may have been the triggering factor.

Egypt has a well-documented battle with the bulge - it has the highest rate of obesity in Africa.
But a weight loss camp north of Cairo hopes to attract people from across the region who want to get rid of their extra rolls.
STORYLINE:
This morning workout pushes the group to their limit and the instructor shows no sign of going easy on them.
But sweat and tears are all part of the process - these people have chosen to join the class to help them get fit.
CHEFOX is a a fitness and weight loss camp launched in 2014 to help people who are seriously eager to lose weight, stay in shape and change their lifestyle.
It was started by Nada Ta'lab who visited a weight loss camp in Europe after struggling with obesity for years.
""I was one of the people who needed complete isolation, needed someone to look after my food, sleeping hours and workouts during the whole 24 hours of the day as well as life couching and nutrition,"" she explains.
""After that I really wanted to make this model happen inside Egypt and to make Egypt a destination that attracts people from all over the MENA region to get this service instead of travelling abroad.""
She explains that the camps are effective because they offer help and support every step of the way.
""We don't give you a programme and leave you to apply it by yourself. Instead we give you your meal with all the nutrients that you need, we make you play more sports than you would have done on your own.""
She also says that being surrounded by people who all have the same goal makes it easier.
One of the camp members, Mohamed El-ra'ey, thinks this is the key to the success of the camp.
""We are here all together in a close community sharing the same target and on the same project which is weight loss.""
Located 15 miles (24 kilometres) north of Cairo, the camp also offers the chance of complete isolation from temptations.
""Actually when you are outside there are a lot of temptations, the outings with family or friends are all about food,"" says camp member Rasha el-Sherif, a Jordanian business development manager living in Abu Dhabi.
""So I found that this is the right environment where there is a lot of support with people like you. You have to eat only what is served and you have to workout as stated in the programme - that's why I liked the idea because its different and you don't have to resist temptations.""
Aside from temptations, Zumba instructor Maggie Balbae says that people also need to gain more confidence in working out.
""I've always noticed that overweight people are shy and they don't feel like attending classes or going to the gym because they have an image about there bodies and they don't feel comfortable,"" she explains.
""But here in CHEFOX they help people to break and overcome that image, they motivate people and help them to lose some weight and a percentage of body fat so that people are able to continue what they have started in CHEFOX after they finish the camp.""
The global obesity problem now affects 1 in 10 people in the world, it is rising in countries rich and poor, and in many countries it is increasing faster in children than adults, according to a new study from the New England Journal of Medicine.
Egypt has the highest rate of obesity in Africa.
Joining the camp costs around 7,000 Egyptian pounds a week (388 US dollars) and the complete cycle is three weeks.

Childhood Obesity is a serious epidemic in North America.  Nearly a third of our children are overweight or obese,...and the numbers continue to rise.
At younger and younger ages, Doctors are treating children with significant medical complications related to being obese, such as, Type-2 Diabetes, Hypertension, and elevated Cholesterol.  

We're at risk of raising supersized kids who may live sicker and die younger than the generation before them.

""Our Supersized Kids"" profiles four families whose grade school children are overweight or obese.  Each of these families are actively working to help their child turn around an out-of-control weight gain.  The documentary highlights their struggles and successes, along with providing helpful tips from Pediatricians.

KSPS exists to improve the quality of life of each person we reach. KSPS content broadens horizons; engages and connects; enlightens, inspires and educates. KSPS is an international multimedia network providing quality programming.","Our Supersized Kids"

The title ""Obese Nation:  Why are Americans So Fat"" was modified from a news story clipping.  It is not meant to offend anyone.  We have to use a title that will entice people to click.  If we said, ""The Real Way to Lose Weight,""  nobody would watch.  So no offense intended.  We also want to point out that Teri lost 50 pounds using the techniques in this video, and she has kept it off.  I myself lost 40 and never regained it.  We did this on our own using the information that we compiled over many years of research.

This video was designed to teach American consumers that there's a way out.  You do not have to be subjected to the tricks of the media, and the massive amounts of misinformation running rampant.  Not everybody is supportive of this effort, however.  

We welcome all comments and opposing opinions.  Most of the comments we've received have been overwhelmingly positive or add tremendous value.  But unfortunately, there have also been threats made, hate speech, racist rhetoric, and very severe abusive language.  After three years of constant trolling and abuse, we decided enough was enough, so we decided to disable the comments section.

A shot of the White Horse which faces The Square, which was then a Watney Combe & Reid pub. Note the red barrel above the sign. This was the new keg beer and heavily promoted at the time. Next door is the Lavender Lady tea room, soon to become a private residence, with the willow trees, planted in 1953 to commemorate the coronation, alongside the village stream.

Improving the quality of health care services and outcomes is a subject of major interest to regional governments, the public, and to the global community. Recent statistics on the quality of health care in the United States published by the ""Remaking American Medicine"" (http://www.ramcampaign.org/pages/qual...) reveal the following striking findings:
- Medical errors kill more people per year than breast cancer, AIDS or road traffic injuries;
- Doctors provide appropriate preventive care only 50% of the time, effective chronic care 60% of the time, and evidence-based acute care only 70% of the time;
- Nearly $400 billion - almost one-third of the total spent on health care each year - is wasted on poor quality health care.

In Kuwait's national midrange plan 2010-2014 and Tony Blair's Kuwait Vision 2030s report, evidence abounds for the need to improve the quality of health care:

- Increase in the number of Kuwaiti nationals seeking medical care abroad;
- The need for improving the quality of health care services;
- The need to focus on public health, preventive care, and the improvement of healthy lifestyle habits to avert serious illnesses;
- Kuwait lags international standards on the management of obesity and chronic diseases.

Kuwait and the Gulf in general have launched plans and initiatives to improve the quality of health care services and outcome; especially in public hospitals and clinics. These have focused on engaging the private sector.

Through the sessions of the Conference, we seek to find answers to the following questions:
1.How can the quality concepts, models, and programs used to improve the quality of health care?
2.What kind of metrics should be used to assess the quality in health care?
3.How can patient experience and engagement be attained and measured?
4.Has the private sector experienced true improvements in all aspects of quality and safety?
5.How may the interest of patients be protected against the disequilibrium of information and knowledge between the service provider and customer? Can quality concepts and tools help?
6.Does the concept of quality have the same meaning in public and private institutions?
7.What are the challenges facing public providers in their quest to improve health care quality? How may these challenges be addressed in practical terms?
8.What is the role of accreditation in improving quality of health care? How can the interest of the patient be protected against the business nature of the relationship between accreditation bodies and service providers?

Whatever role you assume in the health care sector, we hope that your participation enriches your experience and that of others; providing you with answers to some of your questions and, most importantly, allowing all attendees to be exposed to different perspectives on the concept and application of quality in health care.

We look forward to your active participation in the conference of ""Quality in Health Care - Achieving Quality in Health Care Services and Outcomes.""","Quality in Healthcare Conference - Kuwait"

More on the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/054...

First serialized by Rolling Stone in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to Upton Sinclair's classic muckraking novel The Jungle. The book was adapted into a film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater.

The book is divided into two sections, ""The American Way,"" which interrogates the beginnings of the Fast Food Nation within the context of post-World War II America; and ""Meat and Potatoes,"" which examines the specific mechanizations of the fast-food industry, including the chemical flavoring of the food, the production of cattle and chickens, the working conditions of beef industry, the dangers of eating meat, and the global context of fast food as an American cultural export.

Fast Food Nation opens with discussion of Carl N. Karcher and the McDonalds brothers, examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of Ray Kroc and Walt Disney's complicated relationship as well as each man's rise to fame. This chapter also considers the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits Colorado Springs, CO and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee: fast-food restaurants employ the highest rate of low-wage workers, have among the highest turnover rates, and pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of its employees than any other American industry.

The second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agriculture world in a new economy. Schlosser is perhaps most provocative when he critiques the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America. Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become exponentially more hazardous since the centralization of the industry: the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed provides an ideal setting for E coli to spread. Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War: the collapse of Soviet Communism has allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.

The book continues with an account of the evolution of fast food and how it has coincided with the advent of the automobile. Schlosser explains the transformation from countless independent restaurants to a few uniform franchises. ""The extraordinary growth of the fast food industry has been driven by fundamental changes in American society... During that period, women entered the workforce in record numbers, often motivated less by a feminist perspective than by a need to pay the bills. In 1975, about one-third of American mothers with young children worked outside the home; today almost two-thirds of such mothers are employed. As the sociologists Cameron Lynne Macdonald and Carmen Sirianni have noted, the entry of so many women into the workforce has greatly increased demand for the types of services that housewives traditionally perform: cooking, cleaning, and child care. A generation ago, three-quarters of the money used to buy food in the United States was spent to prepare meals at home. Today about half of the money used to buy food is spent at restaurants - mainly at fast food restaurants.""

Regarding the topic of child-targeted marketing, Schlosser explains how the McDonald's Corporation modeled its marketing tactics on The Walt Disney Company, which inspired the creation of advertising icons such as Ronald McDonald and his sidekicks. Marketing executives intended that this marketing shift would result not only in attracting children, but their parents and grandparents as well. More importantly, the tactic would instill brand loyalty that would persist through adulthood through nostalgic associations to McDonald's. Schlosser also discusses the tactic's ills: the exploitation of children's naïveté and trusting nature.

In marketing to children, Schlosser suggests, corporations have infiltrated schools through sponsorship and quid pro quo. He sees that reductions in corporate taxation have come at the expense of school funding, thereby presenting many corporations with the opportunity for sponsorship with those same schools.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2rAAQPL 

People are fatter than ever. Obesity has more than doubled since 1980. But the biggest rise is in the developing world.

Anyone with a body mass index, or BMI, over 30 is considered obese. The higher your BMI, the greater your risk of developing weight-related diseases like diabetes and heart disease.

Nearly half of the world’s overweight and obese children under five years old, live in Asia. And in Africa, the number of overweight children under five has increased by nearly 50% since 2000.
 
Hunger still blights many parts of the world. But the share of people who do not have enough to eat is in decline. Globally one in nine people in the world suffer from chronic undernourishment.

One in ten are obese. 

If current trends continue, the share of obese children in the world will surpass the number of undernourished by 2022. 

Africa has the fastest-growing middle class in the world. A move from traditional foods to high-calorie fast food and a more sedentary lifestyle is driving the rise in obesity. Fast food outlets like KFC and McDonalds have seen rapid growth on the continent. 

Women appear to be most affected. More than half of women in Botswana are overweight. Ethiopia known for its terrible famine, has seen obesity rates in women rise by 600% since 1984.

Health systems in Africa, more focused on treating malnourishment and diseases like malaria and HIV, are ill equipped to deal with obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes. 

Pacific islands have the highest obesity rates in the world, thanks to the spread of western fast food. Diets which a generation ago consisted of fish and coconuts are now dominated by processed meat.

Nauru is top of the list. 61% of the population are obese, making this tiny paradise island the world’s fattest nation. 

Cook Islands take second place, with an obesity rate of 56% and Marshall Islands come in third, with 53%.

The Middle East is also in the grip of an obesity crisis. In the Saudi Arabia and Qatar and Kuwait more than a third of the population is obese. 

Obesity is already a global epidemic and is rapidly spreading from the rich world to the poor.

Mexico has a 32.8 percent adult obesity rate, while the US has a rate 31.8 percent. The report stated that weight-related diabetes is on the rise, with almost one in six Mexican adults falling victim to the illness. Some 100,000 Mexicans are dying per year due to contracting diabetes.

The rise in obesity and related deaths has been ascribed to the increased consumption of fast food and sugary sodas. Mexican food is widely known to be calorific, with delicacies like burritos, nachos, tacos and quesadillas packing on the pounds. Dr. Abelardo Avila Curiel from the National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition traces the trend to the low cost of such produce, saying: ""For the first time in our history, we see individuals becoming obese and malnourished within just a few years. This is an extremely serious matter.""

Curiel stressed the importance of the food industry as a factor in the crisis, saying: ""Our food consumption habit is being ruled by the sector of the food industry that produces the so called junk food. This means food that has no positive nutritional value and which consumption, at the volumes we are ingesting them, is extremely harmful to our health. That means the obesity epidemic in our society cannot be explained without taking in consideration the exaggerated consumption of these products.""","Mexico: Mexico outweighs US on obesity scale"

Step 3: Provide healthy foods
Provide your children with healthy meals and snacks, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products.

Tip
Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.

Step 4: Go to mypyramid.com
Go to ""mypyramid.com"":http://www.mypyramid.gov/ to help your family get general diet and lifestyle recommendations.

Step 5: Involve your family
Involve your family in planning, shopping, and preparing the meals. Sit down as a family as much as possible.

Tip
Encourage your family to try a variety of foods.

Step 6: Teach your children
Teach your children at an early age about food and nutrition so children develop healthy eating habits for life.

Step 7: Set a good example
Set a good example for your children by making smart choices about your own lifestyle. Help prevent obesity and future chronic diseases from occurring.

The fattest place on earth isn't in America.

The tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru holds that honor. At only 8.1 sq. miles, with a population of less than 10,000, the country's inhabitants have virtually become giants.

Ninety-five percent of the island's adult population is overweight, and 85 percent of the male adult population is obese, according to ABC News.

However, island natives haven't always been this fat. According to ABC, it wasn't until they began importing Western food that the population's size exploded. Now half of Nauruans suffer from Type II diabetes.","The Fattest Place on Earth"

Evette is a university student who left a country that was her comfort zone, and moved to one that helped shape her identity more than she had ever expected. This humorous talk comes from a positive speaker who simply adores the stage.

Lebanese rooted and raised in Kuwait, Evette Abou Samra is a life enthusiast with an adventurous side, always up to trying new things and never falling into routine. She has an immense passion for theatre and arts and lives by the motto: 'If you’re the smartest person in the room then you’re in the wrong room.'

The Pacific Islands can appear like an idyllic palm-fringed paradise. But many of these tiny and isolated countries are struggling to survive, facing weak governance, unemployment and faltering economies. 

They also face a health crisis - obesity. Until the mid-20th century, most Pacific islanders survived on a diet of fish, fruit and vegetables. But with globalisation and a more sedentary lifestyle, today the Pacific is home to eight of the 10 fattest countries on earth. 

On this edition of 101 East, we ask: What is the future of the islands of the South Pacific?

We're told that if we are overweight, it's because we can't control ourselves. Personal responsibility has been cited as a cause of obesity over and over again. If that were true one third of America should be considered irresponsible. Deborah Cohen debunks this myth and provides the real causes of the obesity epidemic and how we can stop them.

Dr. Cohen is a physician and Senior Scientist at the RAND Corporation and is the Principal Investigator of several studies on the intersection of the built environment and health.  She is the author of the new book ""A Big Fat Crisis—the Hidden Forces Behind the Obesity Epidemic—and How We Can End It"" and the co-author of the book, ""Prescription for a Healthy Nation—a new approach to improving our health by fixing our everyday world"". She is the lead researcher on several studies investigating ways to change the environment to reduce the burden of chronic diseases. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","A big fat crisis -- stopping the real causes of the obesity epidemic | Deborah Cohen | TEDxUCRSalon"

A bedridden Saudi man, Khalid Moshin Shaeri, weighs in at 610 kg, making him one of the heaviest people in the world. He has been home for the last two-and-a-half-years. Not by choice, but because he could not get out of the house, despite needing hospital treatment.

That treatment had to wait until now. His home was partly demolished to get him out in a specially designed bed. A forklift eased him into a waiting ambulance from where he was transferred to an aircraft bound for King Fahd Medical City in Riyadh.

Khalid will undergo dietary treatment and physical programmes to help him lose weight.

https://youtu.be/01QQWQGGFoI


Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat addition that may ruin health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).
Adults
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:
• Overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
• Obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.


What causes obesity and overweight?
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been:
• an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat; and
• an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.


Record numbers of Americans are obese, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 70% of Americans are now either obese or overweight by this measure. However, the statistics are particularly worrying. Almost 40% of adults are obese. The childhood obesity rate, for ages 6-19, has increased to 20%.
Childhood obesity is linked to increased mortality rates in adulthood, and obesity can lead to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
It’s hardly a uniquely American problem though — the World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the number of obese kids and adolescents has risen tenfold over the last four decades, around the world.

Processed Foods Are Universal
Americans who are poor and obese don’t live in a food desert, they may live in an area where frozen corn dogs sold at the local dollar store are more affordable than fresh fruits and vegetables sold in a supermarket.
Nonstop Stress
From job insecurity and high unemployment to a dysfunctional health insurance system, life has becoming increasingly stressful in the U.S.—and research shows a strong link between stress and weight gain.
Poor Work/Life Balance
Seven Powerful Ideas That Influence the Way We Think has pointed out that obesity is one of the results of Americans’ poor work/life balance.
Lack of Universal Healthcare
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 has given millions of previously uninsured Americans access to health insurance. But millions of other Americans remain uninsured, and cut off from things that discourage obesity, such as programs promoting wealth loss or weight management. 
Powerful Junk Food Lobby
The lobby that’s doing the most to promote poor health may very well be the junk food lobby, which spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy in Washington, DC. 

WHO response
Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2004, the ""WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health"" describes the actions needed to support healthy diets and regular physical activity. The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.

As our bodies process the food we eat, proteins, fats and carbohydrates are converted into energy. 
 The daily energy requirements vary on each person and can be calculated depending on genre, age, weight and physical activity level. Our bodies use energy for basal metabolism, physical activity and thermoregulation. Basal metabolism is defined as the least amount of energy that the body requires to live while awake and represents about 70% of the daily energy requirements. Thermoregulation is a process that allows the body to keep the temperature it needs to function properly. If the energy intake is above the requirement, this will result in weight gain.
 Obesity is a condition characterized by the excessive accumulation and storage of fat in the body. Body mass index BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. Obesity is defined by a BMI 30 or greater. 
Based on the BMI the severity of obesity can be classified into 3:
Class I: 30-34.9; 
Class II: 35-39.9; 
Class III: over 40
 Adipocytes are the cells that compose the adipose or fat tissue.  
 The adipose tissue grows by two mechanisms: hypertrophy, meaning an increase in adipocytes size and hyperplasia, meaning an increase in number of adipocytes. 
 Hypertrophic obesity is an android-like type of obesity, the onset is at an adult age and it is associated with metabolic disorders. Android or male-type obesity is characterized by a dominant upper thoracic and visceral distribution of adipose tissue. This distribution causes an apple-shaped body.
 Hyperplastic obesity is an gynecoid-like type of obesity, the onset is at an early age, usually before 20 years old, and it is usually treatment-resistant. Gynecoid or feminine-type obesity is characterized by a distribution of the adipose tissue predominantly in the lower part of the body, meaning hips and thighs. This distribution causes a pear-shaped body.
 Note that the android-type obesity can appear in both women and men and that the gynecoid-type obesity can appear in both women and men as well.
Android-type obesity compared to gynecoid-type is recognized as a stronger cardiovascular risk factor and it is associated with increased risk of developing arterial hypertension, high levels of the lipids in the blood, resistance to insulin, which in time may lead to diabetes.
 There are three main goals of the obesity treatment: 
- loosing weight: it is recommended to loose 0.5 kg a week, targeting to loose 10 kg in 20 weeks
- maintaining the new body weight
- managing the risk factors associated with obesity such as smoking, arterial hypertension, diabetes, high levels of lipids in the blood. 
 Some of the benefits of loosing 10 kg are: it decreases by up to 40% the obesity-linked mortality, it lowers the levels of blood pressure and lipids in the blood, in the newly diagnosed with diabetes it can lower the blood sugar levels in the morning by up to 50%. 
 The treatment is based on changes in diet and physical activity. Diet should be low in calories, fats and sugars. Some physical activity ideas are: jogging, biking, swimming. Medication and surgical treatment are available but are recommended only in selected cases.

 Serious measures should be taken to prevent and reduce obesity as it shortens life and decreases life quality!

Come along with us as I explore the Kuwaiti fish market, enjoy some dinner, and wrap up my last night in Kuwait City, Kuwait!

Local Tour Kuwait: http://localtourkuwait.com/

My adventure began on a hot October night at Souk Al Mubarakiya in Kuwait City. It’s the oldest souk, or Arab market, in Kuwait, and one of the oldest in the Gulf region. It’s over 200 years old! 

We stopped at a shop selling beads where the prices range from half a Kuwaiti dinar to 2,000 Kuwaiti dinar (KD). The vendor said he had a billion of them! I browsed for a while, and I eventually bought a golden one for two KD, or about $6 USD, to keep in my car!

Then, I visited a shop that sells Kuwaiti perfume. It was really nice! There were tons of varieties you can try, as well as more that were for sale and some that were half-price. Everyone working there was super nice!

From there, we headed to the fish market. I could smell the fish before we got there. It wasn’t very big, but there was a ton of variety there. They had everything, including shrimp, many fish, crab, and more. We bought some fish and then took it to a nearby restaurant for them to cook it up for us! We’d also have some kebabs and bread along with the fish.

I loved the chill setting of the restaurant. It was part of a restaurant row behind the fish market. We got some herbs with lemon to start. It was 10 p.m., so I was starving!

There were multiple ways we could dig in to our feast. I got some fish first and dug through it to get rid of the bones. Then, I grabbed some bread and ate it with it. I loved the spices and herbs in the fish, which was a little creamy and falls apart easily. It didn’t have too many bones, so it was good! The top layer of fish was my favorite part!

Then, I went for the beef kebab with the bread. The kebab was so tender and smoky. It was amazing! Then, I added some herbs to the kebabs and bread. What a phenomenal meal! 

Then, I dug into the fish with my hands to get more of the flesh and sauce. Then, we ended our meal with some black tea, which I added some mint to. It was really minty and tasted like Moroccan tea. I’d had some tea like it in Jordan as well!

After that, I headed back to the kitchens, where I saw them making Irani biryani, a delicious-looking shrimp dish, more fish, sautéed onions, and kebabs. Everything looked so good, and everyone working there was super friendly! 

Then, Yousef and I headed to the fruit and vegetable part of the market. I saw never-ending dates, including some covered in sesame seeds. It was extremely sweet and dense. It’s what the locals break their fast with during Ramadan. Then, I tried a fruit that looked like a hard grape but tasted like an apple! 

Around 11:30, the shops started closing up. I recommend coming here early, around 7 p.m. and eating around 8 so you still have time to explore afterward. As we continued on, I met more men who wanted to have a quick chat with me. Everyone in Kuwait was so friendly!

Then, we came across a shisha area, but I didn’t want to try any this time. We stopped at a shop, where we negotiated a price for a cup and a coffee container. I took them for about $10 USD. They were the most authentic things I’d found.

By the time we left, the Souk was completely quiet and closed down. There were so many alleyways. You could spend hours here! What a night!

If you’d like to explore Kuwait, I recommend hiring Local Tour Kuwait to show you around!

""45% of people in Kuwait between the ages of 6-19 are overweight,"" the text says."" Obesity inhibits activity in the area of the brain affecting language, memory, vision and speech,"" A final WARNING sign appears with more facts about the side affects of obesity: ""Obesity can cause high blood pressure, insomnia, depression, and low self-esteem."" The sound of a balloon popping over this final message is meant to startle and wake up the audience to the dangers of early obesity.

This video was created by Suhaila Al-Salem, a board member and active leader within the civil society organization, Women Cultural Social Society. She wishes to educate both parents and youth about possible health complications caused by childhood obesity, a relatively new problem in Kuwait. Suhaila would like to create a movement of Kuwaitis committed to tackling the issue of childhood obesity, and to build a widespread public awareness campaigns through this and other Public Service Announcements. She also wishes to call parents attention to bad habits formed by their children at an early age, such as eating while watching television or playing video games, neglecting to exercise, and over-consuming fast foods, which result in weight gain and impaired health.

In addition to Suhaila's activism, she organizes women's health initiatives through Women Cultural Society, and activities for women to gain business and networking skills to open their own businesses in Kuwait.
She is the primary contact for the Kuwait NGO Film Club that formed after a two-week workshop led by Barefoot Workshops at the Radisson SAS in Kuwait. She plans to continue creating her own PSA's and facilitating monthly meeting for the club. Please contact Suhaila if you would like to join the Kuwait NGO Film Club, or if you would like to broadcast the groups PSA's on regional networks in The Middle East.

Background:
This Public Service Announcement (PSA) was produced locally in Kuwait City, Kuwait as part of a media workshop, entitled ""Media, Activism and Democracy,"" led by Barefoot Workshops in partnership with The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI). Thirteen participants from seven organizations, mostly women and youth, learned how to write, shoot, produce and edit, thirty-second noncommercial videos (Public Service Announcements), to raise awareness about social issues. The goal of the workshops was to increase discussion, debate and civic participation in the Middle East. The PSAs are available in Arabic and English to broadcasters and other organizations that wish to distribute them ""rights-free"" on television and/or the Internet.

In secondary school, I would starve myself, I would have frequent trips to the toilet just to puke out my food. And I kept this a secret from everybody for quite a while.

I remember I kept a diary in secondary school and I wrote a lot of things I hated about myself. One day, my mum found out about the diary and she asked me what was wrong. I just bawled in front of her. On the outside, I was this bubbly kind of buffoon.

Childhood Obesity is a serious epidemic in North America.  Nearly a third of our children are overweight or obese,...and the numbers continue to rise.
At younger and younger ages, Doctors are treating children with significant medical complications related to being obese, such as, Type-2 Diabetes, Hypertension, and elevated Cholesterol.  

We're at risk of raising supersized kids who may live sicker and die younger than the generation before them.

""Our Supersized Kids"" profiles four families whose grade school children are overweight or obese.  Each of these families are actively working to help their child turn around an out-of-control weight gain.  The documentary highlights their struggles and successes, along with providing helpful tips from Pediatricians.

KSPS exists to improve the quality of life of each person we reach. KSPS content broadens horizons; engages and connects; enlightens, inspires and educates. KSPS is an international multimedia network providing quality programming.","Our Supersized Kids"

Facts about obesity are displayed in simple text with the sound of chewing and slurping in the background. The text says, ""Children from Ages 5-19 are most affected by Obesity,"" and ""The main reason for childhood obesity is eating while watching television or doing homework."" The boy finishes his soft drink and the message appears, ""Treat Your Body Right"". The PSA was made by Suhaila Al-Salem, a board member, and active leader within the civil society organization, Women Cultural Social Society. She wishes to educate both parents and youth about health complications caused by childhood obesity, a relatively new problem in Kuwait.

In addition to Suhaila's activism, she organizes women's health initiatives through Women Cultural Society, and activities for women to gain business and networking skills to open their own businesses in Kuwait.
She is the primary contact for the Kuwait NGO Film Club that formed after a two-week workshop led by Barefoot Workshops at the Radisson SAS in Kuwait. She plans to continue creating her own PSA's and facilitating monthly meeting for the club. Please contact Suhaila if you would like to join the Kuwait NGO Film Club, or if you would like to broadcast the groups PSA's on regional networks in The Middle East.

Background:
This Public Service Announcement (PSA) was produced locally in Kuwait City, Kuwait as part of a media workshop, entitled ""Media, Activism and Democracy,"" led by Barefoot Workshops in partnership with The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI). Thirteen participants from seven organizations, mostly women and youth, learned how to write, shoot, produce and edit, thirty-second noncommercial videos (Public Service Announcements), to raise awareness about social issues. The goal of the workshops was to increase discussion, debate and civic participation in the Middle East. The PSAs are available in Arabic and English to broadcasters and other organizations that wish to distribute them ""rights-free"" on television and/or the Internet.

Obesity has always been an issue, even from antiquity, but in recent times it has reached epidemic proportions. For that matter, many scientists and doctors refer to it as the plague of the twenty-first century. What makes this issue even worse is that in the West, especially in the United States, political correctness has seemingly restrained the freedom for a much needed discourse over the ills and dangers of this epidemic. Most people know that it's not healthy, yet few know that it can lead to death.

Obesity is responsible for a number of fatal diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, certain types of cancer, gallbladder disease and gallstones, osteoarthritis, gout, and the list just goes on. As if the physical and overall health impact was not enough, few are aware of obesity's psychological toll such as low self-esteem, depression, and suicide. It's a serious issue and we want to shed some light on it, so today we are going to share with you 25 tragic things you might want to know about obesity. Aesthetics has nothing to do with it. Rather, it's about a higher quality of life.

There are more people today worldwide who suffer from obesity than hunger or starvation.

Research has shown that people who eat out for dinner or breakfast rather than a home-cooked meal usually end up obese.

Also, lack of sleep is one of the best allies of obesity. Even if you don’t eat unhealthy, lack of sleep can cause you to gain up to two pounds of fat in a week.

Contrary to popular belief, the USA is not the fattest nation in the world; it ranks eleventh, with thirty-two percent of the population being obese.

The honor of “fattest” country goes to Kuwait, with an incredible 42.8% of its population being obese. 

Annual health costs related to obesity in the United States surpass $200 billion, while over twenty-one percent of medical costs in the United States can be attributed to obesity.

Modern medicine attributes forty-four percent of the diabetes burden, twenty-three percent of the ischemic heart disease burden, and between seven and forty-one percent of certain cancer burdens exclusively to being overweight and obesity.

According to the American Cancer Society 572,000 Americans die of cancer each year, about one-third of these deaths are linked to excess body weight, poor nutrition, and/or physical inactivity.

In the early nineties no state had an obesity rate above fifteen percent. Today there are forty-one states with obesity rates over twenty-five percent, according to the Trust for America’s Health.

Some of us might think that drinking diet soda isn’t harmful, but a study from the University of Texas shows us otherwise. The study followed 474 diet soda drinkers for nearly a decade and found that their waists grew seventy percent more than those of non-diet soda drinkers.

Now 6 years on, Miranda is back.  Weighing 259kgs, she's Still Big, still battling..... but  hoping to be transformed by a life saving operation.
Miranda relies on her daughters to care for her -- to help her toilet, bath, dress and travel.  But Miranda's daughters are growing up, becoming teenagers and wanting to live their own lives.   
Miranda is desperate to have an apronectomy at Waikato Hospital, in which surgeons would remove a 50kg flab that hangs down to Miranda's knees and which makes walking difficult.   With the 50 kg flab removed Miranda would be more mobile and able to care for her self, but at Miranda's size, it's a risky operation.  Miranda pleads with the surgeon ""It's a win win situation for me -- if I have the surgery my daughters will be free and if I die during the surgery my daughters will be free"".
We join Miranda for a year -- a catalytic year of desperation to lose weight, children growing up, boyfriends, teenage pregnancy, and the death of Sharon a dear friend and partner in the obesity battle.   A year of struggle, determination and courage.
Miranda's raw honesty gives a very intimate insight into a very complex disease -- obesity.","Miranda gray taufa ( BIG)"

Many are the result of kids' lifestyles and are, according to the experts, causing them unnecessary suffering.

With unprecedented access to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, this documentary meets the kids, the pediatricians treating them and follows them home in an attempt to uncover the root cause of their problems. It is clear that some of the basic health messages from the doctors are not getting through to parents.

The A&E is a busy department and having to deal with cases such as drunk children is not only time consuming for staff, but can be upsetting for other young patients too. Operations on dental, glue ear and obesity cases are helping clog up a system that's already under considerable strain. The hospital estimates they spend around a million pounds a year on treating preventable conditions, enough to buy them a new MRI scanner.

The Good, the Bad & the Messy – our channel features documentaries and shows about stories of modern parenting. Through a mixture of original & archive content, we explore a range of captivating subjects; education styles, complex relationships, food habits, the challenges of large families…

It's very important to realize that obesity is an illness that affects you from your head to your toes, meaning that it really does affect every part of your body. Obesity leads to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, also it can lead to increased risk of diabetes. In addition, liver problems are associated with being obese. 

In fact, liver transplant is now becoming necessary in many patients who are obese, because obesity can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, necessitating a need for a new liver. Something that many people don't know is that obesity can cause an increased risk in many cancers, and these are cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and even colon cancer. 

Infertility is a problem that affects many people and obesity is sometimes the culprit, and this is true for both men and women. For women, there's something called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS, and oftentimes this is associated with obesity, and so women may not ovulate and therefore, they're not able to get pregnant. And in men, obesity does affect the quality of the sperm. The good news though is that if you do lose the weight, many times a lot of these health problems can be reversed.

Sleep apnea is an illness that is associated with obesity that many people aren't even aware that they have. Sleep apnea occurs when you're sleeping, and you actually stop breathing for periods of time, and your oxygen level becomes dangerously low. The good news though, is that sleep apnea is something that is reversed in many people, once they're able to lose even a small amount of weight. So these are just a few of the many health problems that are caused by obesity.","Health Problems Caused by Obesity | Obesity"

Hence, the people who have BMI over 30 are directly linked with deaths caused by obesity.


Also, the death rates from obesity give us an accurate comparison of differences in its mortality impacts between countries and over time. In contrast to the share of deaths that we studied before, death rates are not influenced by how other causes or risk factors for death are changing.


According to WHO,  around the world, 13% of adults aged 18 years and older were obese in 2016.6 Obesity is defined as having a body-mass index equal to or greater than 30.

This video highlights the difference between the food environment of America and Japan. America's obesity rate is about 30% (biggest state is 37.7%, smallest 22.3%) whereas Japan's obesity rate is 3.5%
While there's other countries on each side of the obesity spectrum, I chose to compare these two because I grew up in America and spent the last 7 years here in Japan. The places that I describe as ""reasonably healthy"" in Japan aren't necessarily places I recommend as ""optimally healthy"" - I'm simply point out that while convenient food in America ranges from very unhealthy to unhealthy, convenient food in Japan ranges from very unhealthy to pretty healthy.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WDAJlQtcFM","Take a wide range of fast-food outlets, add long working hours, a sedentary lifestyle and a reliance on cars to get around - and you've got a recipe for obesity, diabetes and heart problems.
So say health experts in the United Arab Emirates - where two thirds of men and almost three-quarters of women are overweight.
Expatriates are also piling on the pounds - and turning to a range of solutions in the battle against the bulge.
STORYLINE:
As one of the most cosmopolitan countries in the world, the UAE caters for all nationalities and tastes.
And that includes fast food.
Whether you want burgers and chips or pizza and wings, you don't have to walk far to find it in the Gulf state.
Chances are you won't be walking far at all, though - staggeringly high temperatures for much of the year mean that most people rarely walk outside.  
In the UAE the car is king - depriving Emiratis and expats alike of the rare opportunity for exercise.
Little surprise, then, that obesity rates are rocketing.
According to the World Health Organisation, some 67 percent of Emirati men and 72 percent of Emirati women are overweight.  
Almost 40 percent of women in the UAE are clinically obese - the seventh highest proportion in the world.
More than a quarter of men are obese - the ninth highest.
That has led to a rise in weight-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, with which experts say 22 percent of the population has been diagnosed.
Children are affected, too.
Almost a third are overweight or obese - and children as young as eight are being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes and hypertension.
There are no figures for the expat population, who make up about 80 percent of the population, but experts say they are also following the trend.
Many of those expats are now turning to weight-loss experts to beat the bulge.
Take Aakriti Mago, who sought out nutritionist Rashi Chowdhary.
She subsequently dropped her dress size from 16 to 12 - and is now aiming for size 10.
And it's clear to Mago what's to blame for all the expanding waistlines.
""I think it's the ease of getting fast food all around you,"" she says. ""So Even if you are driving every 10 seconds or so you'll see a McDonald's, KFC, you've got these little cafeterias that sell shawarmas (kebabs) and fried nuggets and unhealthy stuff.""
""I think it's just that, especially with the lifestyle that we have here, if we are working late it's so easily available,"" she adds.
Chowdhary, who runs a nutrition and weight-loss centre in Dubai, says the number of expats using her service has doubled in the past year.
And once people gain weight, she says, they often search for quick fixes such as diets, pills and appetite suppressants.
Chowdhary blames both the sedentary lifestyle in the UAE and its affluence for the alarming rise in obesity.
But she also worries about the perception that people there have about health, weight loss and fitness.
""Most people want guarantees,"" she explains. ""You know, 'I want to lose five kgs (kilograms, about 11 pounds) in five weeks or five years'."" 
""So what happens with this kind of thinking is that you might lose those kgs but you don't realise that when you lose it too fast it's probably just muscle and water, and what happens then (is) it always comes back,"" Chowdhary says.
She maintains that people who want to lose weight need to make basic lifestyle changes - such as eating healthy food and doing more exercise.
Among those treading the right path is Chris Dcosta, an Indian-Canadian national.
He moved to the UAE nine years ago and has since put on 50 kilos (110 pounds).
Chris now weighs 148 kilos (326 pounds) - and points the finger of blame at his long working hours.
And that isn't Chris's only motivation to lose weight.

This year's target has been set to 80,000 recruits, up from 68,000 the year before, and the edict comes at a low point for recruitment enthusiasm. Low unemployment rates have made the Army less appealing for young people, as have more than 15 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. To make matters worse, a rise in obesity rates means that only some of the young people who are interested in enlisting in the armed forces can even qualify.

So the Army is looking inward, reforming itself to make the prospect of serving more attractive. These initiatives include increasing bonuses, allowing more waivers for people who have used marijuana, and helping potential recruits to lose weight.

Elle Reeve visited Fort Knox to see how recruiters are adapting to their new mission.

The death of General Qassem Soleimani, the high-profile leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force, now threatens to unleash a fresh wave of instability and conflict throughout the Middle East. 

Iran and Iraq fought one of the longest and bloodiest wars of the 20th century, which cost the lives of more than a million people and cemented the two countries’ rivalry in the decades that followed.But after ISIS took over wide swaths of Iraq, Iran came to Iraq's aid. 

After the defeat of ISIS, VICE correspondent Isobel Yeung travels to Iraq to see how Iran is exerting its growing influence over the war-torn country ahead of parliamentary elections.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1vtpbzhTJ4","A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.

Hover over a country for details.
In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Pregnant women that are obese may suffer from complications that can lead to health problems for the mother or child. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.

Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their tradition cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:

Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)
Tonga (Average BMI: 31.9)
Samoa (Average BMI: 31.7)
Kuwait (Average BMI: 30)
Saint Kitts and Nevis (Average BMI: 29.7)
Saint Lucia (Average BMI: 29.6)
Kiribati (Average BMI: 29.6)
Palau (Average BMI: 29.4)
Micronesia (Average BMI: 29.4)
Tuvalu (Average BMI: 29.3)

ABOUT THIS VIDEO: This video covers an article from the New England Journal of Medicine. Ward and his associates developed projections based on NHANES (National Health And Nutrition Survey) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey since the early 1990s. The bottom line: By 2030, over half of the people in the US would have a BMI over 30. Moreover, over 1 in 4 would have a BMI greater than 35, and that's called morbid obesity. (Morbid means it's having immediate & obvious terrible effects on health.) While the methods used were sound, I am optimistic we can still prevent such things from happening.

ABOUT DR. BREWER:
Dr. Brewer started as an Emergency Doctor. After seeing too many preventable heart attacks, he went to Johns Hopkins to learn Preventive Medicine. While there, he went on the run the post-graduate training program (residency) in Preventive Medicine. From there, he made a career of practicing and managing preventive medicine and primary care clinics. His later role in this area was Chief Medical Officer for Premise, which has close to 1,000 primary care/prevention clinics. He was also the Chief Medical Officer for MDLIVE, the second largest telemedicine company. More recently, he founded PrevMed, a heart attack & stroke prevention clinic.

At PrevMed, we focus on heart attack, stroke, and cognitive decline. We serve patients who have already experienced an event as well as those who have not developed a diagnosis or event. Dr. Brewer provides services via telemedicine or in-person if you're in the Lexington, KY area. We find a lot of undiagnosed prediabetes or insulin resistance. Treating unrecognized risk factors like prediabetes allows the reduction of risk and prevention of disease.

Which countries are most obese nations in the world ?

A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. This number continues to rise. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity. The worldwide obesity rate has tripled since 1975.

In addition to dramatically decreasing a person’s lifespan, the quality of life of an obese person is affected. There are numerous health risks, including higher risks of diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer. Pregnant women that are obese may suffer from complications that can lead to health problems for the mother or child. Other health risks from diabetes include osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, kidney disease, strokes, and high blood pressure.

Obesity isn’t just limited to one part of the world. Nations everywhere have obese citizens. Some, however, have a far high proportion than others. These nations are categorized as the Most Obese Nations in the World. While some think that the richest and the most developed countries in the world are the most obese, this isn’t always the case. In fact, the United States and the United Kingdom are two of the most economically rich and developed countries in the world. However, they are only ranked 12th and 36th, respectively, when compared to other nations.

There have been multiple nations with small economies that have been classified as the most obese, and the World Health Organization says that the rising costs of healthy food and food scarcity in underdeveloped nations is a contributing factor to obesity.

The least obese countries in world have obesity rates lower than 2%. The five least obese countries in the world are Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Eritrea, Madagascar.

The country of Nauru is the most obese country, with 61% of its population having a BMI higher than 30. The Nauru obesity problem, like many other South Pacific countries, is possibly attributed to Western settlers who taught them to fry their food and import less healthy food, abandoning their traditional cultivation, preparation and preserving skills.

Kuwait is the fourth most obese country, with an average BMI of 30. Kuwait's obesity is blamed on the arrival of American fast food restaurants, which have taken over and replaced local food. As a result, diabetes has also been on the rise in Kuwait.

Behind Nauru, Cook Islands and Palau are the second and third most obese nations, with obese people making up 55.9% and 55.3%, respectively. The top 10 most obese nations are as follows:
Here is the list of World's Most Obese Countries:

Nauru (Average BMI: 32.5)
Tonga (Average BMI: 31.9)
Samoa (Average BMI: 31.7)
Kuwait (Average BMI: 30)
Saint Kitts and Nevis (Average BMI: 29.7)
Saint Lucia (Average BMI: 29.6)
Kiribati (Average BMI: 29.6)
Palau (Average BMI: 29.4)
Micronesia (Average BMI: 29.4)
Tuvalu (Average BMI: 29.3)

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

This is exactly what scientists at Oxford University plan to do – to find new methods so people can make healthier food choices, control their weight and reduce their chances of heart diseases.

Public Health England reports that between 2012 and 2014 nearly 61% of adults were obese which means that the majority of the population is not only overweight but also susceptible to developing serious life-long maladies such as diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.

To get to the bottom of this issue, a set of three studies will be funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration and the scientists will theme their researches around behavioral issues regarding diet and obesity through low calorie foods, self-monitoring and awareness of food low in saturated fats.

UK has been termed “the fat man of Europe” because it contains the highest number of obese people in Western Europe. According to a report by National Health Services (NHS), in 2014, 58% of women and 65% of men were obese and consequently, 60% of bariatric surgery patients were aged 35 to 54. One of the major factors of obesity is an abstinence from physical activity.

This plus-size abdominal binder provides abdominal compression as well as support. This can help one recovery following surgery to the region, plus it can help with a number of other injuries such as abdominal strain or low-back pain, just to name a few. This bariatric abdominal binder can accelerate the healing process.

Some examples of post-surgical care include after liposuction, hysterectomy or tummy tuck surgery, postnatal (after pregnancy), especially if you had a Cesarean section or multiple birth delivery, or following hernia surgery.

In addition to speeding up your recovery process, the compression also helps transfer stress away from your lower back, diminishing back pain and protecting against further damage. The 12-inch abdominal support also promotes better posture, which in and of itself can help ease pain.

Regardless of what this plus-size ab binder is used for, you can be assured it will provide comfortable support and compression. The extra-large abdominal binder is constructed of premium panel elastic, with soft plush backing on the inside. Plus, the discreet white color and low-profile fit of the tummy wrap for large people means it easily fits beneath your clothes.

The lower the quality of food we ingest the worse the outcome is in terms of our health. Eating food filled with antibiotics, hormones, and artificial additives means that all of these will find their way into our bodies. (Click here to find out more about their effects on the body) 

We believe that organic food is safer for our bodies and decided to live a healthier life. Unfortunately, healthy food options are not only limited in Kuwait they are also difficult to find. Out of this need for readily available healthy food the idea for an online organic store was born. 

Kuwait is one of the fattest countries in the world. Diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease are burdening the healthcare system.

Twenty-two-stone Darran Mansfield has been told by his doctor that he is on the brink of full-blown diabetes, yet he's too stubborn to change his unhealthy ways. So will witnessing the effects of living an ultra-lazy lifestyle in Kuwait and meeting a 51-stone recluse have a big enough impact to get the Brits to radically turn their lives around?

Commissioned by the University of Otago's Edgar National Centre for Diabetes and Obesity Research, this video highlights the devastating impact obesity can have on individual health and the unbearable strain an unchecked epidemic will put on New Zealand's health services.

The video explores how to change the current ""obesogenic"" environment -- which provides easy access to far too much energy-dense food and does not encourage physical activity -- to one which supports people to make healthier lifestyle choices.

Features comment by leading obesity researchers and interviews including a School Principal, MPs and the Managing Director of McDonald's New Zealand.","The Obesity Epidemic in New Zealand"

Remember, the Powers that Be could NOT Rule the World unless most of us are Sick and Disconnected, which is why Food is being used as a Weapon System so that the Status Quo can remain the Status Quo.

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about the answer to obesity. Since 1970 obesity has tripled in adults and almost tripled in children. He also talked about how it is obvious to see what is causing obesity through food statistics.  

Since 1970 obesity has tripled in adults and almost tripled in children. The answers is in the foods statistics. I want to see if you can figure this out. So this data is based on America 2014 on what an average American consumes per day. I put a link down below to see the entire report. Number 1 vegetables, an average American consumes 1.6 cups of vegetables per day. Protein 7.1 ounces. Fat 63 grams daily, so we got 44.7 grams of vegetable fat and 14.7 grams of saturated fat. Grains, .48 lbs, that’s half a pound a day 174lbs a year. Sugar 23teaspoons per day or a 131lbs a year. Now this is added sugar, it is not the sugar within the food. What do you think? Go ahead and type it in the comment section, I’ll wait for you answer. We’ll give you a couple of minutes. Actually this is recorded, I can’t do that. But it is pretty obvious to me, look at this, vegetables 1.6 cups per day. We need 7 to 10 cups. Fat 63 grams, that is not unreasonable. This is too high though vegetable oil because this is actually soy, canola, corn, GMO. This is a problem. Grains half a pound a day, is that too much? That is way too much. Half a pound of grains and you’re taking half of pound of grains as well. And then we have added sugars 23 teaspoons per day, is that excessive? How many is acceptable? Less than 1? Zero? I don’t know if it’s just me, but it so obvious what is causing this. We need to increase the vegetables, we need to cut down vegetable oil, we need to eliminate these two (Grains and Sugars) right here and this (Obesity) will go away. So some people will tell you it’s the saturated fat, but we are only consuming 14.7 grams of saturated fats every single day, that is not the problem. These are the problems. Go ahead and type down your comments and your opinion below. I’m really curious what you think about this data.

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

People featured in this film: Marion Nestle, Marlene Schwartz, John Bode, Nelson Eusebio, J. Justin Wilson, Dr. Olajide Williams, Lauren Von Der Pool, Julie Paradis, Cathal Armstrong, Ed Bruske,

The amount of weight lost was calculated by Diet Care and Taiba Hospital based on weight checks of GHK subscribers conducted at the beginning and the end of their 28-day weight loss program.

According to the World Health Organization, over 25% of people in Kuwait suffer from diabetes or its complications, while other studies show that over 80% of Kuwait is overweight.  Gethealthykuwait.com is a community-based initiative that helps people get healthy through real, one-on-one help.

The first place winner of cycle 2 is Nawaf Al-Thabian, who managed to lose 18.9% of his body weight after following gethealthykuwait.com's 28 day-program. Al-Thabian suffered from weight problems before the program, where he use to have sleeping problems and problems kneeling during prayer. Today, Al-Thabian enjoys a healthier and faster-paced lifestyle.","KUWAIT LOSES OVER A TON OF FAT!"

Government statistics in Turkey show a third of Turks are obese and another third are overweight.

Statistics suggest only 20 percent of Turks exercise regularly.

The government is trying to encourage people to ‘fight the flab’ by providing outdoor sports areas.

--------------------
Globally, an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980. The global prevalence of diabetes has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult population. This reflects an increase in associated risk factors such as being overweight or obese. Over the past decade, diabetes prevalence has risen faster in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and lower limb amputation. Healthy diet, physical activity and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. In addition diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with medication, regular screening and treatment for complications.

In 2007 General Assembly adopted resolution 61/225 designating 14 November as World Diabetes Day. The document recognized “the urgent need to pursue multilateral efforts to promote and improve human health, and provide access to treatment and health-care education.”

The resolution also encouraged Member States to develop national policies for the prevention, treatment and care of diabetes in line with the sustainable development of their health-care systems.","Qatar: Sweet Epidemic (Diabetes)"

With almost two-thirds of Australian adults tipping the scales as overweight or obese, The Obesity Myth will break down barriers to social cohesion by challenging commonly held views of obesity. The Doctors at Austin Health are taking a different approach by treating obesity as a chronic genetic disease. Patients are told, often for the first time in their life, their weight problems are not their fault, but often primarily the result of a genetic predisposition. The Austin's treatment regimen, which is a last resort for many patients who are at risk of early death due to their weight, uses a combination of diet, medication and bariatric surgery to transform bodies and lives.","The Obesity Myth Part 1"

More and more companies are implementing AI into their searches, but many are now speaking out against algorithms' hidden sexist and racist biases.

Subscribe to Journeyman here: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...

A man and a woman use Facebook to search for jobs using exactly the same criteria - both are suggested a very different array of potential jobs! With algorithms becoming an increasingly large part of our everyday lives, many are raising the alarm that purportedly 'neutral' searches are filtering applicants based on sexist biases and stereotypes. Nicolas Kayser-Bril, whose investigation uncovered sexism in Facebook and Google's algorithms says: 'Discrimination takes place before anyone clicks on the advert. Optimisation is done according to unknown criteria. For many, the problem is in who creates the algorithms: ‘We have a percentage of 90% white and European men [at my university] and they're bound to make things programmed for them. I don't think it's voluntary.’ Some warn that far from being objective, algorithm-based discrimination is a continuation of an old problem. 'The algorithm replicated what we used to do: for a promotion or a good salary, it was better to be a man … they need to re-evaluate how they manage human resources.’

Hey fatties, listen up! A new study called F as in Fat: How Obesity Threatens America's Future 2012, says we're all going to be fatter and sicker by 2030.

The obesity battle is going pear-shaped real quick according to this study. Healthcare costs and obesity-related diseases are expected to sharply increase in all states by 2030, with Mississippi bearing the worst of it.

Current obesity rates hover at around 35 percent. By 2030 this number could increase to 60 percent or more. The study also points out that along with the increase in obesity, there will be more cases of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and strokes, hypertension and arthritis.

So you'd better dust off those running shoes and apologize to your gym for standing them up if you don't want be part of these awful statistics. Or just chill and watch more YouTube videos!","Adult obesity rates 2030: Americans, you'll be even fatter"

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University’s human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

Some experts say that obesity will not be tackled properly until it is seen as a disease but others say this could be dangerous.

According to the World Health Organisation, 30% of adults in the UK are obese and that number has tripled since 1980, making the UK the most obese country in western Europe.

Obesity is a serious medical condition of excess fat storage. It's defined as a person having a BMI of 30 or greater. BMI, or body mass index, is a number that is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. Obesity begins at a BMI of 30 and 40 or greater is considered actually morbid obesity.

Obesity is an epidemic in our country. Over one third of adults are obese. Another scary statistic is that greater than 17% of our children and adolescents are obese. This number is growing each year. Another scary thing is that obesity has actually surpassed smoking as being the number one cause of preventable death. While this statistic is scary, the good news is that there is something that you can do about it. Because when you do lose the weight your risk of premature death decreases drastically. 

Something many people don't know is that diet and exercise are very difficult. A lot of people, while they may lose weight, a lot of them are not able to keep that off. Something that you should know is that for conventional diet and exercise only about 1% of people who are morbidly obese, or whose BMI is 40 or greater, only 1% of those people will keep half of the weight off that they lost after five years. 

Obesity carries with it several health risks. 85% of type II diabetics are obese. These are just statistics of obesity that I think it's important for you to know.","Obesity Statistics You Should Know | Obesity"
