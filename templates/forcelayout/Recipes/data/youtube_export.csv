Over the past few decades, the obesity problem in America has grown into a major health disaster. It affects a lot of organs and obesity is home to some of the major and most fatal health issues. In the U.S., two out of three Americans are considered obese.

In the 21st century, it has also been observed that America is the nation in the entire world with the highest percentage of people falling under the category of obese. Here are some of the facts related to the obesity problem in America.

Obesity is serious, common and very costly
• 78.6 million Or 34.9% people in America are obese.
• The health conditions related to obesity include a few kinds of cancers, Type II diabetes, stroke and heart diseases.
• The overall medical cost infused in treating obese, on an estimated level, was $147 billion in the year 2008 in America. As far as individual is concerned, the medical costs for such people are usually $1,429 higher in contrast with the ones with normal weight.

Obesity is archetypical to a few groups

Non-Hispanic blacks are considered to be more prone to obesity. They have the most number of (47.8%) age-adjusted obesity rates. They are followed by other groups, such as Hispanics with 42.5%, non-Hispanic whites with the obesity rate of 32.6%, and non-Hispanic Asians having 10.8% obesity rate.
People in their middle ages, i.e., from 40-59 years, are the ones who are more likely to be obese with 39.5%, in comparison to the younger population, i.e., 20-39 years with 30.3%.","The Obesity Problem in America"

The American dinner plate is deficient in nutritious produce, and part of the problem is cost. Because diets low in fruits and vegetables have serious consequences, health advocates have tried to incentivizes Americans to choose apples over donuts for years but with little success.

In the US, a nation with high rates of diseases such as obesity and diabetes , a variety of strategies - from a junk food tax to a produce prescription program - are now being tested. But there are a number of factors that still stand in the way of Americans having healthier, more affordable produce and dietary options.

Childhood Obesity is a serious epidemic in North America.  Nearly a third of our children are overweight or obese,...and the numbers continue to rise.
At younger and younger ages, Doctors are treating children with significant medical complications related to being obese, such as, Type-2 Diabetes, Hypertension, and elevated Cholesterol.  

We're at risk of raising supersized kids who may live sicker and die younger than the generation before them.

""Our Supersized Kids"" profiles four families whose grade school children are overweight or obese.  Each of these families are actively working to help their child turn around an out-of-control weight gain.  The documentary highlights their struggles and successes, along with providing helpful tips from Pediatricians.

KSPS exists to improve the quality of life of each person we reach. KSPS content broadens horizons; engages and connects; enlightens, inspires and educates. KSPS is an international multimedia network providing quality programming.","Our Supersized Kids"

The latest World Health Organization data indicates that 1.9 billion people worldwide are overweight, with 600 million considered obese. Sugar, in the form of processed, high-in-sugar foods are largely to blame.

Scientists around the world are making a desperate plea to stop an epidemic of obesity. But now, new research goes beyond fat to reveal a risk that could be even greater.

TechKnow explores the science of sugar at the Department of Molecular Bioscience School at the University of California-Davis where cutting-edge research is being done. The project, headed by Dr Kimber Stanhope, put healthy young adults in their 20s on a highly controlled sugary diet for 10 weeks and then measured the effects of that added sugar.

TechKnow explores the correlation between sugar intake and heart disease in young adults.

The fattest place on earth isn't in America.

The tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru holds that honor. At only 8.1 sq. miles, with a population of less than 10,000, the country's inhabitants have virtually become giants.

Ninety-five percent of the island's adult population is overweight, and 85 percent of the male adult population is obese, according to ABC News.

However, island natives haven't always been this fat. According to ABC, it wasn't until they began importing Western food that the population's size exploded. Now half of Nauruans suffer from Type II diabetes.","The Fattest Place on Earth"

The body mass index, better known as BMI, is a measure of obesity that has been in use for over 200 years. It was a formula created by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part it’s okay for those types of studies. However, when individual health is the topic at hand, using the body mass index can make judging a person’s health a little bit trickier.

With billions of fans scheduled to tune into the upcoming 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hasan examines how the game has evolved from a sport of British colonizers into a tool of diplomacy and a force for good despite recent scandals and corruption.

It’s kind of how we screen people for obesity. It’s a measure of your weight divided by your height,” said Dr. Lee Coghill, a global health fellowship physician with Lee Health. 

Your body mass index, or BMI, measures the amount of fat tissue a patient has. A patient is considered overweight if they have a BMI over 30.  “We know that once you get to a certain weight, it becomes more and more difficult to lose the weight with just diet and exercise alone,” said Dr. Coghill. 

This is why doctors are having the conversation with their patients early, in hopes of preventing obesity and future health problems. “There are really strong studies that show an increase in heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and lots of different cancers with them,” said Dr. Coghill. 

Adding 20 minutes of daily exercise and subtracting high-calorie snacks can make a big difference to your weight and health. “Specifically, potato chips are one of the recognized number one things that cause increased weight gain in middle-aged men and women,” said Dr. Coghill.  

As patients age, a higher body weight means a higher risk of health problems. “Some of the modifiable risk factors are fast foods, sugary beverages, physical inactivity, child obesity, which we can combat,” said Dr. Coghill. 

Small changes to your diet and lifestyle can make big improvements to your health.

Hope you enjoy! 
Thanks!

Transcription of the video:

Hey, it's Adam Foote with ThinnerIn30, and today I want show you three exercises that can really help target your hips to help lose hip fat. All right, so the first one is going to be something simple, you can do at home. You're going to come down on all fours, and it's going be a side hip raise. 

So just like a dog peeing on a fire hydrant, if you picture that, all right? That's what you're going to do with your hip. So on all fours, take the hip straight out to the side. You're going to do 15 repetitions. Notice how my foot's not up here, back here, just bring the foot straight level. 

15 reps and you're really going to feel it in the glutes and hips, and you're going to do forward circles, so kind of like you are getting on a horse. So big forward circles, 15 that direction, 15 backwards, all right? So we're going to do that three step combo: side raise, forward circles, backwards circles, and then from right there, you're going to go into a bird dog. 

So opposite hand, opposite leg and you're going to go elbow to knee. All right you're going to really feel that right hip screaming. Ok, side, forward, backwards. Then were going to do something with the powerband, and I'll have a link where you can click these and get these for cheap on Amazon. 

But basically these are resistance bands you put around your knees and this is going to help target the glutes, and the hips as well. Alright. So put it around the knees. You're going to lay on your side, heel to heel. So feet together and you're just going to open your knees keeping the heels together and back down. And you're really target that hip, I mean, crazy isolation on that hip. OK? So, 15 of those. 

So the goal will be 15 repetitions of each exercise, three rounds through, all right? So 15 repetitions, three rounds through. See how your hips feel after that, I'll promise you'll be burning some hip fat with that. 

For more information, click link below. Thanks, guys.","How To Lose Hip Fat"

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University’s human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

Worse, the city's weight problem has been passed down to its children. Rather than accepting the grim statistics, leaders of the town nicknamed ""Fat City"" began a campaign to combat their citizens' poor exercise and eating habits, as well as the poverty that often leads to obesity. But is it enough?

Nearly 70 percent of San Antonio residents are overweight or obese -- a figure that climbs to 80 percent in the poorest neighborhoods. Like much of the nation, the city is eating itself into an early grave. But the town's ""Fit City"" program promoting walking, fitness and eating healthy snacks offers some ope. The quest is: Will Fat City one day be able to call itself Fit City?

Kaiser Permanente - Nutritional Update for Physicians: Plant-Based Diets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6uuH...

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) just published their update for the 2013 US Adult Obesity Facts, and they are not good. More than one-third (34.9%) of the United States is obese. That's 78.6 million US adults that are obese. Not a single state was found to have a rate less than 20% obesity. 

This is a national healthcare crisis. Obesity was estimated to cost us $147 Billion back in 2008. This is not only hurting our health, but our economy as well. Is this really an obesity epidemic crisis or just food poisoning? 

According to Kaiser Permanente, the number 1 manage care organization in the country, stated that, ""Physicians should consider recommending a plant-based diet to all their patients, especially those with high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity."" If this is the NUMBER 1 manage care organization in the NATION, every citizen of this country should know about the benefits of a plant based diet. I think it's time we see some changes.

The danger of equating obesity as a disease is discussed and we urge caution regarding obesity related surgeries and medications. Additionally, a holistic lifestyle is discussed and advocated.

Obesity rates in America are disturbing.  Today obesity in America shows that 7 out of 10 Americans are overweight, heading towards obesity.  Stop for a moment and consider what that means. Because if this rate continues, and there’s no reason to believe it won’t, we will be faced with a health disaster beyond anything we’ve ever experienced before. It’ll be a nightmare scenario, because if we allow these figures to continue to grow, and there’s no reason they won’t, we’ll soon be faced with the probability that 10 out of 10 Americans will be Obese.

The implications of mass obesity are frightening.  We know obesity doesn’t stand still, it goes on to become Morbid Obesity. That’s a deadly disease that forces you to become bedridden because it makes body movements virtually impossible. Morbid Obesity will inevitably lead to death.  So will this be the future for 10 out of 10 Americans, by the middle of this century?  By today’s growing obesity rates in America, it is almost guaranteed. The reason nobody is offering a solution, other than futile diets and strenuous exercise is that nobody actually knows what has caused the obesity, when it began, and what we can all do about it. If we unravel the truth and expose what happened 50 years ago. Because this obesity epidemic was no accident.

It is not something we did to ourselves, it’s something that was done to us, 50 years ago, to enable a brutal industry to break our Basic Instinct, Intuitive Eating, to enable them to take over our everyday diet. They continue to do that, secretly and will keep doing it till they own our entire market of food.

You have only one chance to learn the truth. The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat will be revealed very soon. It’ll reveal not only the whole awful true story of what was done behind our backs 50 years ago. It’ll also show you, step by Step, Exactly What You Can Do to get back the slim healthy body nature meant you to have. A webinar will be launched as soon as we have enough subscribers to fill the room.  Download the free report, and get your friends to do the same, to be sure you’ll get an invitation.

Some experts say that obesity will not be tackled properly until it is seen as a disease but others say this could be dangerous.

According to the World Health Organisation, 30% of adults in the UK are obese and that number has tripled since 1980, making the UK the most obese country in western Europe.

I think most of us know that we put on weight when we eat too much, and don’t exercise enough. So the first reason that pops into my head is that our modern world encourages us to sit indoors all day. With all the new electronic gadgets such as computers, gaming consoles, mobile phones, TVs, etc., there are more reasons than ever to stay inside.

Kid's in America are more obese than any other country in the world because they are exposed to more television commercials for food than any other nation. One study found that kid's exposed to television commercials snacked 45% more than the group exposed to no advertising. 45% more food! That along with the lazy lifestyle of tv watching and video games do not add up to being healthy and fit. The main issue is advertising and giving kid's whatever kind of food they want which is usually rich in sugar, preservatives, gmo's and more junk! Your job is to help your child be healthy, and teach them ways to explore happiness for themselves. Ice cream or other short term fixes that you think make your child happy actually harm your child's health and teach them to be dependent on junk food and sugar for happiness, do you think that's a healthy habit to instill in them at a young age? 

Healthy Wild And Free is a blog, podcast and community focused on living healthier, greener lives.  The growth of the mind, body and spirit are some of the most enriching and rewarding experiences in life!

Soda consumption can cause weight gain and other damaging health effects. The high spike in soda consumption in Mexico may even be the cause behind the country surpassing the United States in obesity.","Why Did Mexico Surpass America in Obesity?"

The obesity epidemic has spread to the Third World and it is likely 1 billion people will be obese by 2030. So how did it explode in places that, not so long ago, counted malnutrition and even famine as major concerns? Well it's mostly about the aggressive marketing and low prices of Western fast food. As globalisation and a little more money open up Third World markets, the first to step in are the likes of McDonalds and Coke. In this global production, we travel to China where the consumption of sugar and oil has sent the national scales spinning; to Brazil where global food companies have fundamentally altered traditional diets; to India where it's predicted 100 million people will soon be suffering diabetes and on to Mexico, where the weight problem is so pressing, stomach reduction surgery is offered for free. The diagnosis is stark: ""No country has managed the transition to get rid of hunger without it shifting to obesity"" says anti-obesity crusader Barry Popkin. In a world where we are bombarded with messages to eat more hundreds of times a day, it's clear that obesity is a ticking time bomb.","Globesity: Fat's New Frontier"

After a long and welcome decline, Brazil's deforestation rates have begun to rise again, just as climate science shows how desperately we need the forest to survive. 

Now, backed by the country's powerful beef industry, the country's inflammatory new president Jair Bolsonaro has vowed to exploit Brazil's natural resources. Standing in his way: the determined indigenous peoples whose domain over the land are the last, best shot for the rainforest -- and possibly the world's climate.

Category:  Wednesday Afternoon Lectures  
Description:  Lewis Kuller will discuss how obesity is an example of a common source epidemic due to changes or introduction of new behaviors, i.e. lifestyles, which result in introduction of new ""agents,"" such as fast foods or calorically dense foods, into a receptive environment. The development of technology for mass production of low-cost, high-calorically dense foods has resulted in economic advantage, mass marketing, and social acceptability. Over time, this has caused increased risks of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, etc. Successful control of the obesity epidemic requires an understanding of the interrelationship between the host, the agents and the environmental factors.

This video highlights the difference between the food environment of America and Japan. America's obesity rate is about 30% (biggest state is 37.7%, smallest 22.3%) whereas Japan's obesity rate is 3.5%
While there's other countries on each side of the obesity spectrum, I chose to compare these two because I grew up in America and spent the last 7 years here in Japan. The places that I describe as ""reasonably healthy"" in Japan aren't necessarily places I recommend as ""optimally healthy"" - I'm simply point out that while convenient food in America ranges from very unhealthy to unhealthy, convenient food in Japan ranges from very unhealthy to pretty healthy.

Yes we can beat Obesity in America, but not with diets, dieting pills or potions. We need to know the truth to beat obesity in America.

DOWNLOAD FREE eBook: https://kirstenplotkin.com/ebook

Obesity in America has changed us from a nation of slim healthy people to a majority of obese unhealthy people in just 50 years. It’s time we learn the truth about Obesity in America.


Today, obesity in America, affects almost every family in the nation. During the past 50 years, most people have tried to diet, at least once, often dozens of times. During the same period, We have been offered more diets, and more weight loss solutions than we’ll ever be able to count. They have one thing in common, they have all failed to conquer obesity.

What most people don’t realize, is that just 50 years ago, the vast majority of Americans were still slim and healthy. We ate by intuition, and obesity in American did not exist. Dieting was very uncommon, reserved mainly for Diabetics and people who had a Thyroid Condition. Today, obesity in America has become almost inevitable for everybody.  That is not acceptable. It’s time we open our eyes to some unpleasant truth’s we seem determined to ignore.

Obesity is not natural, and we must not think of it as Normal.  Obesity is not normal, it’s dangerous and it kills people. The fact is, it has an origin and it has a cause. It exists because it is founded on an addiction.  Unfortunately, the power behind obesity, is a brutal industry that has no moral boundaries and operates exclusively for profit.  50 years ago, that industry sat on the sidelines, trying to find a way to break our basic instinct, Intuitive Eating.  It was the only thing that stood in their way.

It prevented them from becoming the source of all the food we eat every day. Till then, all our food was provided by growers, dairy farmers and meat producers. This was an industry, ready and eager to substitute those foods, with processed, artificial foods that would create new, much bigger markets of people who would become addicted to the new food. They would be forced to ignore the old food and replace it with addictive driven products that were literally irresistible.

There is no bigger, better, more profitable industry, than one that can be based on an addiction, particularly an addiction sanctioned even approved by those who are supposed to protect us. The only thing that stood in their way was an age old intuitive system, that had kept us slim and healthy for generations. It relied on our basic instinct, intuitive eating, that guided us intuitively to the right food.

Obesity in America was a goal, a target to get people addicted to fake food. It meant intuitive eating had to be broken. The amazing details of how this was done is told in the soon to be launched: The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat. Don’t miss it!

There’s no doubt obesity in America is a massive, growing problem in America, as well as many other countries.  Obesity goes wherever the Food Industry goes.  It’s a harsh thing to say but all too true.  Take a moment to consider this: Until 50 years ago, it was normal to be slim and healthy. How do I know this? I’m 77 years old, I was there and I saw how obesity began. I watched as it grew into a food addiction and a constantly growing obesity epidemic. I also saw has this developed into Diabetes Type2, a dangerous disease that is also beginning to reach epidemic proportions.

But what this should tell us, is that it’s NOT NORMAL to be fat and it’s also not NORMAL TO DIET.  Knowing that it was once NORMAL to be slim should tell us that if we do the right thing for our body we will all be slim, just as nature intended.  Nature didn’t create weight problems, people did that, and they did it with the purpose for the sake of profits.  The 3 World Events That Made Us Fat, tells the whole story of how this happened when it began and who was and still is responsible. It will be launched soon, by a Webinar. 

You’ll want to be there with your family and friends to finally learn about how you were tricked into abandoning a natural way of eating that allowed you to choose your foods intuitively, using you Basic Instinct, Intuitive Eating.  A way to eat that kept us slim and healthy for centuries. That is how it was for everybody, till 50 ago, when an industry decided Intuitive eating had to go because it was preventing them from launching all those colorful, addictive processed foods, they intended to substitute with our natural foods.  They’re fast succeeding. 

So make sure you don’t miss this webinar. Download the free eBook, it will enable us to send you an invitation when a date has been set.

Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly provides a biomedical perspective of obesity, and evaluates which genes could potentially shift the balance towards obesity.

Easy access to nutrients has contributed to the increase in obesity in the human population. But, what is obesity and why isn’t everybody fat? Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly provides a biomedical perspective of obesity, and evaluates which genes could potentially shift the balance towards obesity. As he explains, one becomes obese when the balance between energy intake and energy spent is shifted. Surprisingly, mutations that lead to obesity in humans aren’t in genes involved in metabolism and energy storage, but failure in satiety signals in the brain that result in people eating too much. The excess of energy intake over energy expenditure leads to obesity.

What is the consequence of obesity in human health? Physically, obesity can result in lower mobility and sleeping disorders. But, in humans, the link between obesity and metabolic diseases isn’t straightforward. For example, not everyone that’s obese becomes insulin resistant. As O'Rahilly explains, the probability of an obese individual to have a metabolic disease is linked to the capacity of adipose tissue to store the extra fat. Mutations that decrease fat storage in adipose tissue increase the chance of metabolic diseases, like insulin resistance, even when the person is not obese.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly is a professor of Clinical Biochemistry and Medicine and Head of the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge where he also directs the MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit in the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science. He qualified in Medicine from University College Dublin, and continued his post-graduate training at Oxford University and Harvard Medical School. In 1991, O'Rahilly joined the faculty at Cambridge University where he studies human metabolic and endocrine diseases. O'Rahilly is known for his work in identifying novel extreme human metabolic phenotypes, and identifying genes important in metabolic function and dysfunction.

For his scientific contributions, O'Rahilly was elected as a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999), and the Royal Society (2003). He also became a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (2011), was knighted in the 2013 Birthday Honors for services to medical research and was the 2019 Banting Medal Recipient for Scientific Achievement of the American Diabetes Association.

New federal data released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the number of new diabetes diagnoses fell to about 1.3 million in 2017, down from 1.7 million in 2009.
Earlier research had spotted a decline, and the new report shows it's been going on for close to a decade. But health officials are not celebrating. 
Associated Press Medical Writer Mike Stobbe says that while the numbers are dropping, experts are puzzled as to why. 
Among the possibilities: Changes in testing and getting people to improve their health before becoming diabetic.
The report was published by the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research &amp; Care. The statistics run through 2017. Last year's numbers are not yet available, Benoit said.
Diabetes is a disease in which sugar builds up in the blood. The most common form is tied to obesity, and the number of diabetics ballooned as U.S. obesity rates increased.
The American Diabetes Association recommended the new test, known as the hemoglobin A1C blood test, for routine screening in 2010. Because it's easier to do, it would be expected to lead to more diagnoses. 
But some experts say it may miss a large proportion of early cases in which people aren't showing symptoms. That means the new health tests may be missing people that would have been diagnosed with the older tests. 
The decrease was mainly seen among white adults, the researchers said.
Meanwhile, the overall estimate of how many Americans have diabetes — whether the diagnosis is recent or not — has been holding steady at 80 per 1,000 U.S. adults. That translates to about 21 million Americans.
Diabetes has continued to become more common among young adults and people who are black and Hispanic, the report noted.

The very first McDonald's restaurant appeared in Kuwait on a U.S. military base set up to support the 1991 invasion of Iraq. Since then, the industry has rapidly expanded — there are now hundreds of U.S. fast food restaurants in Kuwait and as a result, the country has become one of the most obese nations on the planet. 

""The begining of fast food, I would say it is part of the Americanization of the culture here."" Dr. Mohsen Bagnied, a professor at the American University of Kuwait told VICE News. Now, Kuwait has roughly double the percentage of diabetic adults than the U.S. 

​The fast food industry isn't just operating in the Middle East. American Fast food brands populate more than 100 countries around the world, occupying six continents. And the global fast food industry is projected to be worth over $600 billion by 2019. 

VICE's Gianna Toboni travels to Kuwait to witness the health effects on a country deep in the throes of an unlikely obsession with U.S. fast food.

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2rAAQPL 

People are fatter than ever. Obesity has more than doubled since 1980. But the biggest rise is in the developing world.

Anyone with a body mass index, or BMI, over 30 is considered obese. The higher your BMI, the greater your risk of developing weight-related diseases like diabetes and heart disease.

Nearly half of the world’s overweight and obese children under five years old, live in Asia. And in Africa, the number of overweight children under five has increased by nearly 50% since 2000.
 
Hunger still blights many parts of the world. But the share of people who do not have enough to eat is in decline. Globally one in nine people in the world suffer from chronic undernourishment.

One in ten are obese. 

If current trends continue, the share of obese children in the world will surpass the number of undernourished by 2022. 

Africa has the fastest-growing middle class in the world. A move from traditional foods to high-calorie fast food and a more sedentary lifestyle is driving the rise in obesity. Fast food outlets like KFC and McDonalds have seen rapid growth on the continent. 

Women appear to be most affected. More than half of women in Botswana are overweight. Ethiopia known for its terrible famine, has seen obesity rates in women rise by 600% since 1984.

Health systems in Africa, more focused on treating malnourishment and diseases like malaria and HIV, are ill equipped to deal with obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes. 

Pacific islands have the highest obesity rates in the world, thanks to the spread of western fast food. Diets which a generation ago consisted of fish and coconuts are now dominated by processed meat.

Nauru is top of the list. 61% of the population are obese, making this tiny paradise island the world’s fattest nation. 

Cook Islands take second place, with an obesity rate of 56% and Marshall Islands come in third, with 53%.

The Middle East is also in the grip of an obesity crisis. In the Saudi Arabia and Qatar and Kuwait more than a third of the population is obese. 

Obesity is already a global epidemic and is rapidly spreading from the rich world to the poor.

Has this government-approved nutritional guideline — the basis of the modern “healthy diet” — led us astray? If so, how did this happen, and what can we learn from it? Cardiologist Dr. Bret Scher offers some food for thought on this very weighty issue.

Script:

Here’s a riddle:

How is it that ever since the government began telling us what to eat, we have gotten fatter and sicker?

In 1977, when the government first set dietary guidelines, the average American male weighed 170 pounds. He now weighs 197. It’s not any better for women —145 to 170. And you don’t need an academic study to know the same thing is happening to kids. Just look around. 

The weight gain has real-life consequences:  the percentage of Americans diagnosed with type 2 diabetes—a condition that can lead to severe medical issues—has risen from 2% in 1977 to over 9% in 2015. In hard numbers, that’s five million people to over 30 million people.

How did this happen?

It all started innocently enough in the 1950s, when President Dwight Eisenhower had a heart attack while in office. Suddenly, the issue of heart health became a national obsession. 

Keep in mind this was an era when scientists had harnessed the power of the atom, unlocked the secrets of DNA, and cured once incurable diseases like polio. Surely, there had to be a scientific solution to heart disease. 

There was. And a charismatic medical researcher from the University of Minnesota named Ancel Keyes had it.

Cholesterol, Keyes claimed, was the villain of the heart disease story. 

His now famous “seven countries study” determined conclusively—in his mind, at least—that people who consumed high amounts of fat—specifically, saturated fat—had higher cholesterol levels and thus, higher rates of heart attacks. 

Lower your fat intake, and you would lower heart disease risk. 

The ever-confident Keyes spread the gospel. As an influential member of the American Heart Association, he was in a very strong position to do so. There was only one problem: Keyes’s study was bad science. The sample size was so small, the data collection integrity so shoddy, and the life-style variables between the countries he studied so great, that his research had no scientific validity. In other words, he asserted a conclusion he couldn’t prove. 

When other scientists questioned Keyes’s conclusions, they were invariably met with stern responses like: “people are dying while you’re quibbling over data points.” And, “there are great benefits and no risks” to adopting this new way of eating.

In 1973, the American Heart Association set the dietary limit on saturated fat at 10%, and in 1977, the US government followed suit. Where did the 10% value come from? It didn’t come from any scientific data. It was merely a government committee’s best guess.  

This was despite contrary evidence like the 1957 Western Electric Company employee study showing no difference in heart attacks in those who ate more or less saturated fat. A longer-term study of the same Western Electric subjects in 1981 reached the same conclusion. But again, no one wanted to hear it.  

To make this all easier to understand and to spread the message to schools, “the food pyramid” was created. That’s the chart you first saw in third or fourth grade with all the supposedly good foods at the bottom—meaning, “eat a lot of those,” and the bad foods at the top—""eat those ones sparingly.” 

What our kids are fed in school, what our military troops are fed on bases, what sick people are fed in hospitals; what crops we plant and how we raise our cattle, are all predicated on this deceptive nutritional concept.

Commissioned by the University of Otago's Edgar National Centre for Diabetes and Obesity Research, this video highlights the devastating impact obesity can have on individual health and the unbearable strain an unchecked epidemic will put on New Zealand's health services.

The video explores how to change the current ""obesogenic"" environment -- which provides easy access to far too much energy-dense food and does not encourage physical activity -- to one which supports people to make healthier lifestyle choices.

Features comment by leading obesity researchers and interviews including a School Principal, MPs and the Managing Director of McDonald's New Zealand.","The Obesity Epidemic in New Zealand"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBTUcBgBVV4","What are the top 10 causes of obesity in children and which ones can be reduced or prevented?

We can group the top 10 into 5 broad categories, each with two key factors:
 
• The first category is Diet -- Arguably the most important contributor to the childhood obesity epidemic is consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.  Sugary calories in liquid form seem to slip under the body weight regulating radar system to a considerable degree, leading to weight gain for susceptible individuals.  In a recent randomized controlled trial from the New Balance Center Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital, we found that adolescents who eliminated sugary beverages weighed about 4 lb less after a year, than those who continued their usual beverage habits.  Among Hispanics, the effects were especially large: 14 lb difference after 1 year.

A more general dietary cause is what can be termed ""ultra-processed products"" -- made in a factory, with a long-list of artificial ingredients, and little resemblance to anything found in nature. Ultraprocessed products are concentrated in calories, but almost totally devoid in nutrition, leading to weight gain and a long list of diet-related chronic diseases.  Even 5 year old patients in our clinic can understand this basic concept: if it comes from a factory instead of nature, just don't eat it!

The Low-Glycemic Diet:

• The second category is Physical activity and inactivity -- TV viewing is in close competition with sugary beverages as the leading driver of excessive weight gain in childhood.  TV viewing causes obesity, not only by displacing physical activities, but also through incessant food advertising.  Kids see thousands of food commercial per year, overwhelmingly for high calorie, low quality products.  
Another important issue, especially for lower income and inner city children, is the lack of regular PE in schools, and safe afterschool recreation opportunities.

Keep Kids Moving:
http://childrenshospitalblog.org/we-n...

• The third category is Family -- The environment outside the home has been called ""toxic"" to our ability to maintain a healthy body weight.  All too often, parents don't adequately protect the home environment and model healthy eating.  Without parental vigilance, the foods kids eat in the home can be as unhealthy as the ones outside.
 
What you can do at home: http://childrenshospital.org/clinical...

• The fourth category is Stress -- too much of it, and too little sleep.  A stressed, tired child will be less likely get off the couch and get active, and more likely to give in to dietary temptations.  In addition, stress and sleep deprivation may alter hormones and metabolism in ways that promotes weight gain.

The importance of sleep: 
http://childrenshospital.org/clinical...

• The fifth category is the Environment -- and most importantly, our car-based transportation system.  Entire suburbs now lack any public transportation, and even sidewalks. To make matters worse, many neighborhoods also lack community parks, playgrounds and bike paths for safe, active recreation.","Top 10 causes of obesity in children - Boston Children's Hospital - Top 20 Health Challenges"
