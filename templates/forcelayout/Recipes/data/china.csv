As long as they’ve lived in their shared home, A-Yi (Cantonese for Auntie) has been a fixture of their daily lives. The elderly Chinese woman started out looking for a spot to store her buggy and collectibles, but over the years she began to grow vegetables in their backyard and forged a strong bond with these housemates, despite no shared language.

Can the roommates overcome the language barrier to tell A-Yi that they are moving and that she will probably lose access to their space? And what will happen to her when they're gone?

ABSTRACT
This qualitative study applied Q methodology to explore general public's perception, attitude and behavior toward obesity and overweight using Twitter's tweets. A total of 76 statements extracted from Twitter status updates mentioning 'obesity' and 'overweight' were selected as the Q-statements. Twenty-one participants attended the sorting process and completed the Q sorts. Factor analysis was then applied on the Q sorts to extract meaningful factors. Three significant factors emerged from a factor analysis of the Q sorts, including obesity stigmatization, causes of obesity, and positive attitude and sentiment toward obesity. The results reveal pervasive negative stereotypes, alienations, and negative attitude toward overweight and obesity. The findings suggest that social media can actually reinforce body satisfaction perception, self-efficacy and stained health behavior. Most importantly, obesity prevention at the individual level should focus on an individual's behavioral change and at the society level requires careful and comprehensive presentation of the issue to the public.

Course description:
This CEU video course explores the diagnostic and treatment principles of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in both Western and Chinese Medicine.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women and yet remains enigmatic. Despite its high prevalence in the population, much controversy remains regarding its diagnosis, its etiology and the most appropriate treatment strategy. In this class we will explore the signs and symptoms of PCOS from both a Western and TCM perspective. Risk factors, screening protocol, and Endocrine Society guidelines for diagnosis and management of PCOS are discussed. TCM syndromes associated with PCOS are presented as well as acupuncture and herbal treatment protocol.

On completion of this class, the participant will:
• Learn to differentiate the signs and symptoms associated with PCOS.
• Learn clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of PCOS as established by NIH and Endocrine Society.
• Learn Western and TCM treatment protocols to address PCOS.

This plus-size abdominal binder provides abdominal compression as well as support. This can help one recovery following surgery to the region, plus it can help with a number of other injuries such as abdominal strain or low-back pain, just to name a few. This bariatric abdominal binder can accelerate the healing process.

Some examples of post-surgical care include after liposuction, hysterectomy or tummy tuck surgery, postnatal (after pregnancy), especially if you had a Cesarean section or multiple birth delivery, or following hernia surgery.

In addition to speeding up your recovery process, the compression also helps transfer stress away from your lower back, diminishing back pain and protecting against further damage. The 12-inch abdominal support also promotes better posture, which in and of itself can help ease pain.

Regardless of what this plus-size ab binder is used for, you can be assured it will provide comfortable support and compression. The extra-large abdominal binder is constructed of premium panel elastic, with soft plush backing on the inside. Plus, the discreet white color and low-profile fit of the tummy wrap for large people means it easily fits beneath your clothes.

These challenges threaten to constrain inclusion, inflate costs, and hamper the delivery of services, with ordinary Filipinos bearing the burden.

How might healthtech make Philippine health care better, faster, and cheaper? This webinar will gather local and regional stakeholders to discuss the latest health innovations, such as telehealth, health information, contact tracing, and insurtech, and ask how they could accelerate the Philippines towards a post-COVID world.

At least two private schools in Shanghai, China’s richest and most modern city, have been admonished by authorities for testing parents and carrying out intrusive surveys, while applicants at a third school complained about a ‘fat parent’ criteria.

“They check parent’s body shapes,” a parent applying to Shanghai’s Qibao Foreign Language School bemoaned, according to a screenshot of social media published by thepaper.cn.
Education officials rebuked Qingpu World Foreign Language School and the nearby Yangpu Primary School for probing applicants’ family histories and setting logic tests for parents.

China’s increasingly wealthy generation of parents often take desperate measures to give their children a good education in the hope that their offspring will land a place at a prestigious foreign university.

Although the one-child policy was abolished in January 2016, many families chose to have one offspring for cultural reasons and because of busy lifestyles.

That child will often be the sole breadwinner in later life.

Shanghai Municipal Education Commission said Qingpu and Yangpu schools had been forced to “apologise in public” and to “cut down enrollment plans next year,” without elaborating.
Qingpu apologised on its website, adding that “negative social impacts were caused because of our ignorance of regulatory requirements.”

Yangpu, meanwhile, said its tests were not related to the enrollment procedure, but were aimed at “relaxing” parents.

The “graphics-based reasoning” was said to be too difficult for most of the test-takers.

An official at Qibao school told The Telegraph that authorities had ordered the school to conduct a “deep investigation”. 

The man, who did not want to be named, said allegations were based on a “rumour”, but refused to deny the school tested parents, saying: “We don’t take foreign media interviews.”

Qingpu charges 30,000 yuan (£3,360) a term for six-year-olds entering the school, while Yangpu charges 11,000 yuan (£1,230) and Qibao 12,500 yuan (£1,400). 

While many parents took to social media to complain about the strict enrolment procedures, some were less critical.

“Just like some schools in other countries require parents to be Christian, I think the requirements from these private schools are reasonable,” a mother who is hoping to enroll her daughter at the one of the schools told the Global Times newspaper.

China has a catchment area system for public schools, and competition for places has seen desperate parents splurge on extremely poor quality property near elite schools.

The Telegraph last year reported on an insect-ridden alleyway in Beijing being sold for a price similar to plush homes in Kensington and Chelsea because of the desirable catchment area.

Private schools – which make up about six per cent of enrolments at Shanghai primary schools - accept students on the basis of interviews and are not permitted to test applicants.

Reports in March said a private school in the southern city of Guangzhou would only enroll students whose parents achieved college degrees or above.

Faced with increasing disability, mortality, health care costs, and lower productivity, obesity is a growing concern for all countries regardless of income level, says a new World Bank report launched here today.

Obesity has a major impact on national economies and on human capital by reducing productivity and life expectancy and increasing disability and health care costs. It is projected that in the next 15 years, the costs of obesity will total more than US$7 trillion in developing countries.

The report Obesity: Health and Economic Consequences of an impending global challenge states that obesity-related diseases are now among the top three killers across the globe, except in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

Recent data show that since 1975 obesity has nearly tripled and now accounts for 4 million deaths worldwide every year.

Factors escalating the obesity epidemic include ultra-processed and sugary foods, reduced physical activity, and higher incomes, which often go hand-in-hand with a higher consumption of unhealthy foods.

“As countries grow economically and per capita income rise, the devastating impacts and burden of obesity will continue to shift toward the poor,” says Dr. Meera Shekar, Global Lead for Nutrition at the World Bank and co-author of the report along with Dr. Barry Popkin from the University of North Carolina.

In China between 2000 and 2009, health care costs associated with obesity grew from half a percent to more than 3 percent of China’s annual health care expenditure. In Brazil, obesity-related health care costs are expected to double, from less than US$6 billion in 2010 to more than US$10 billion in 2050.

In addition to directly increased health care costs, there are also indirect costs associated with, for example, reduced work productivity, absenteeism, and early retirement, which affect individuals and societies.

Many countries across the globe are also suffering from what is referred to as the “double burden of malnutrition”—high stunting and increasing obesity rates, further compromising their human capital.

“One of the most effective ways to address obesity and other non-communicable diseases is by ramping up investments in affordable, quality primary health care”, says Dr. Muhammad Pate, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank. 

“This makes sense both from a health and an economic perspective. Putting more resources on the frontlines to detect and treat conditions early, before they become more serious, saves lives, improves health outcomes, reduces health care costs and strengthens preparedness.”

The report stresses that in order to avoid the rise of obesity in future generations, governments and development partners must adopt a comprehensive approach. 

Effective primary health systems will be crucial together with a strong focus on preventative measures such as mandating the labeling of processed foods;

 increasing consumer education; reducing salt and sugar-sweetened beverages; and investing in early childhood nutrition programs.

The report also highlights the importance of strong fiscal policies, such as taxation of unhealthy foods; and enhancing urban design, such as playgrounds in schools and walking and bicycle paths.

Dr. Manning reviews 2 studies from the national Library of Medicine's archives.


Truly good, organic REISHI mushroom (as well as others) is, in fact, a world class SUPER FOOD.  Unfortunately, almost none of the many sources I've tested in the last 35 months have measured-up to the REISHI (Ganoderma Lucidum) used in ORGANO's coffees and teas.  To be clear --- I absolutely love these products.  I drink them EVERY day. 

However - I keep on testing.  That's what I've done in my chiropractic Applied Kinesiology practice for 34 years... and, I believe that I have FINALLY found another fantastic source!  -- a company called REAL MUSHROOMS, out of British Columbia, Canada.  I'm delighted to have recently added these amazing products to my nutritional toolbox at the office.

Applied Kinesiological testing on patients has demonstrated equal.. and sometimes superior results vs. Organo's products!  AND -- they are more reasonably priced.  I consume a lot - so that makes me happy :)

Explore the REAL MUSHROOMS awesome lineup of nutritional supports here.  You can shop their site online as well...

Rumors surrounding North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's health problems, which has drawn global attention since Monday, are possibly to end in a flurry of misinformation. This is because both the U.S. and South Korea have denied related reports. US President Donald Trump rejected CNN’s reports that Kim was ailing at Thursday’s daily briefing. The South Korean government also re-confirmed that there is no unusual activity in North Korea with media-driven speculation that Kim Jong-un may be seriously ill. However, as Kim Jong-un is not showing up in public, whether the controversy over his health will subside remains to be seen.

This according to a new study from the University of Sussex in England. For the most obese children, the number rises to 55 to 60 percent. Examining the height and weight data of 100,000 children and their parents from the United Kingdom, the United States, China, Indonesia, Spain and Mexico, results show that more than half of obesity is determined by genetics and family environment. Dolton said, ""These findings should make us rethink the extent to which obesity is the result of family factors, and our genetic inheritance, rather than decisions made by us as individuals.""","Obesity in children partly inherited from parents, Study finds"

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhe_cyrHNpI","What happens when you combine ferocious Siberian tigers with modern technology? Bouncing, pouncing, and even a bit of trouncing. 

Video footage of a habitat for these rare felines in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province shows them meandering about until they catch sight of a reporter's drone used to film with a camera buzzing around. 

The chubby tigers played cat and mouse with the drone until a two or three-year-old tiger swiped at the camera, a large paw filling its screen before losing signal. 

The group proceeded to tear the drone apart, with one literally chewing on the gadget as if it was a bird of prey. 

Unlike a bird, the drone started to give off smoke, which scared off the surrounding tigers. 

Staff members of the park in a well-protected vehicle then went to pick up the remains of the drone. 

Don't worry. Although they seem overweight, Liu Dan, chief engineer with the Siberian Tiger Park, said they weigh within their normal range. 

The park increased the tigers' food intake to keep out the cold in winter. It won't be as necessary to feed them as much during spring as it is in winter. Experts predict that they will once again be lean in about two months.

The speaker makes strong assertions about a specific diet that lack sufficient scientific evidence for general prescription. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...


According to the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest study of disease risk factors in history; funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) the #1 cause of both death and disability in the United States is our diet. Cigarettes now only kill about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet appears to kill hundreds of thousands more. The good news is that means we have tremendous power over our health destiny and longevity. Healthy eating has the potential to not only prevent, but reverse some of our leading causes of death including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Why, then, is nutrition not the #1 thing taught in medical school? American physician, author, and speaker on public health issues, particularly the benefits of a whole foods, plant-based diet and the harms of eating animal products. He is a vegan and the creator of NutritionFacts.org. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Canada, the United States and Mexico are off to a fresh start with a revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

It has been a very productive ride for Mexico during the 24 year NAFTA agreement. For example, its GDP per capita jumped up over 20 percent.

But there have been some downsides too. Especially in the way Mexicans consume and eat.

Correspondent Lara Rodriguez takes a closer look at the post-NAFTA eating habits and food-related illnesses in Mexico.

The explosion in Beirut was so powerful, shockwaves were felt hundreds of kilometres away. Crystal Goomansingh reports on the devastation it left behind.

Canada’s top doctor said Tuesday that restrictions put in place to fight the novel coronavirus could remain in place for years, even with a vaccine. Mike Le Couteur has more on that story.

New clinical guidelines published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal are changing how doctors treat and measure obesity. As Mike Drolet explains, the issue is more complex than counting calories, exercising and the body mass index (BMI).

Thousands of unsolicited envelopes of seeds from China are showing up in mailboxes around the world. But why? Sarah MacDonald reports on the investigation underway, and what you should do if you receive a seedy package.

Canadian researchers have made the first cancer diagnosis in a dinosaur. Heather Yourex-West explains how the discovery was made, and the commonality it reveals between humans and dinosaurs.

As the country is gripped by the Coronavirus crisis, being overweight and its associated health risks are being highlighted as never before.  There is a staggering ten-fold increased risk of death from COVID-19 for those with obesity and the conditions associated with metabolic syndrome such as type 2 diabetes.

Meanwhile, scientists have warned people not to smoke after a French study has suggested smokers could be less likely to get symptomatic coronavirus. Researchers in France have put forward the idea that nicotine could protect against infection, and one study has shown an unusually low proportion of Covid-19 patients in hospitals to be smokers.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2UGe3TbccM","The PRC is in the final stage of reaching its goal of eliminating poverty by the end of 2020. But just how does China define ""poverty""? The PRC defines poverty as a yearly income of less than about $350! That's about the same level, corrected for inflation, of what Europeans, for example King Louis XVI on the eve of the French Revolution, pegged poverty--the price of a loaf of bread a day! But our press will report headlines declaring the China has eliminated poverty! Some, but not all, of these articles explain just how low the Chinese poverty rate is set. 
Imagine the press response if President Trump issued an Executive Order lowering the threshold of US poverty to $350 a year! I doubt the headlines would read ""Trump Eliminates Poverty in the United States! Don't you?

OBESITY RATE

A person is obese when their Body Mass Index is higher than 30. The BMI measures a person’s weight in relation to their height, giving them a score. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.

The number of obese people in the world total is approximately 2.1 billion, which makes up about 30% of the total population. Over 3 million people each year die from obesity.

Obesity has become a very serious global problem, and the World Health Organization claimed that over 1.5 billion adults were overweight, over 200 million men and nearly over 300 million were obese. 

Although China's obesity rate is still half that in the United States, the U.K. and Australia, it has led to a worrying rise in chronic diseases such as strokes, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Can childhood obesity be prevented? 

Each year, ten of thousands of parents from all over China, send their children to Weight Loss camps, commonly known as ""Fat camps"" to lose weight. Each parent pays about 30,000 Yuan (US$4,700) for the six-week, residential program.  The residential camps are open to 7 to 55-year-old who are overweight or obese. In the camps, the participants are given balanced meals and exercise for six hours each day and the regime includes weight training, yoga, running and football.  

Health experts advised the early-childhood years, from 3 to 7-year-old be key milestones for the inculcation and the formation of healthy eating habits. Many of the habits established at this young age were also likely to be carried into adulthood. The experts also noted that sooner the parents started to equip themselves with nutrition knowledge and inculcating healthy eating habits in their children, the higher the child's chances of making wise food choices in school and throughout life.

As a parent you can be a good role model for healthful food choices and regular exercise for your child. Your child's excess weight depends on you; you can help to prevent obesity in your child.

Another investigation has discovered that the utilization of pesticides expands the danger of creating obesity by disabling gut and gut microbiota. 

Chlorpyrifos has been a private bug spray since the late nineteenth century, and it is still among the most generally utilized sort of pesticide around the globe because of its optimal bioactivity. Past examinations demonstrate that introduction to the pesticide may cause obesity and diabetes, however the basic system of how it functions stays obscure. 

Specialists from China Agriculture University concentrated on the human gut microbiota, the most essential small scale biological community in the body. 

Gut microbiota, containing many trillions of microorganisms, has essential impacts incorporating into insusceptibility and body weight. It can enable the body to process certain sustenances that the stomach and small digestive tract have not had the capacity to process. 

In creature tests, analysts put the pesticide into the sustenance and water of mice. They found the pesticide admission broke the uprightness of the gut hindrance, prompting an expanded section of a poison into the body lastly aggravation, which eventually instigated insulin opposition and obesity. 

Insulin obstruction is generally observed in fat individuals and assumes a key job in the advancement of diabetes. 

As indicated by Wang Peng, lead scientist, the expanded poison bearing microorganisms populace in the body further upsets the gut microbiota balance, making the mice acquire fat. 

In addition, comparable outcomes were seen in mice with various hereditary foundations and diet propensities, showing that qualities and diet had restricted effect on the modified gut and gut microbiota. 

The exploration was distributed in the universal diary Microbiome. 

""Our outcomes propose that across the board utilization of pesticides may add to the overall pandemic of aggravation related ailments,"" Wang said.

Description:  Global diets are increasingly facing the dual challenge of undernourishment and obesity. UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier de Schutter, has released a new report calling for a reassessment of unhealthy food systems in both rich and poor countries. Both are increasingly characterized by an abundance of low nutrition, high calorie, processed foods. A recent study by Sarah Clark, Corinna Hawkes, Sophia Murphy, Karen Hansen-Kuhn and David Wallinga in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health  examines the role U.S. agriculture and trade policies play in contributing to the rise in obesity, with a spotlight on Mexico.

Also, India has the second highest number of obese children in the world after China, according to an alarming study which found that 14.4 million kids in the country have excess weight.

Obesity is the major reason for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and other lifestyle diseases. Several researchers have highlighted that obesity accounts for 80-85 per cent of the risk of developing type-2 diabetes mellitus.  

Globally, over two billion children and adults suffer from health problems related to being overweight or obese, and an increasing percentage of people die from these health conditions, researchers have said. So it is the need of the hour that we educate everyone regarding healthy eating and active lifestyle to keep these diseases at bay.""

Obesity has become a very serious global problem, and the World Health Organization claimed that over 1.5 billion adults were overweight, over 200 million men and nearly over 300 million were obese. 

Obesity is most acute in China's biggest urban cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, where people enjoy higher incomes, eat richer foods and lead more sedentary lifestyles.

The prevalence of fast food is a major culprit, extra-high amounts of salt, sugar and oil in Chinese cooking is another factor contributing to the sharp rise in obesity.

Although China's obesity rate is still half that in the United States, the U.K. and Australia, it has led to a worrying rise in chronic diseases such as strokes, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Can childhood obesity be prevented? 

Each year, ten of thousands of parents from all over China, send their children to Weight Loss camps, commonly known as ""Fat camps"" to lose weight. Each parent pays about 30,000 Yuan (US$4,700) for the six-week, residential program.  The residential camps are open to 7 to 55-year-old who are overweight or obese. In the camps, the participants are given balanced meals and exercise for six hours each day and the regime includes weight training, yoga, running and football.

THIRTY-STONE Caitlin Finley makes a living stuffing her face with calorific treats and exposing her wobbly flab on camera. The 22-year-old earns up to £130 a week and hopes to become one of the biggest names on the ‘supersize big beautiful woman’ scene.  But shockingly, rather than being appalled by her career choice, her mother Dorothy, 50, has given her her blessing and even acts as her photographer and is happy for her to scoff junk. Four ft 11 Caitlin from Kentucky, USA, – who guzzles up 10,000 calories a day – and despite being a dress-size 24 and having a BMI of 80 insists she’s healthy and has check-ups several time a year with her doctor. Despite Caitlin's expanding waistline, her mum - who works with special needs children - is surprisingly happy to encourage her.

In fact, witchcraft here is not only alive; it’s thriving, and it’s even feared by politicians. There are hundreds of witches in the country, and they make and break marriages, cure diseases, cast or release people from good and evil spells, and predict the future. Supposedly, one in ten Romanians visits a witch.

Working with him on the couple projects we did together was fun, and memorable.  We always talked about a TV series, but his busy schedule, as well as my own, never allowed our paths to intersect.  Directing his first comedy special ""Just Correct"" after finishing Last Comic Standing was a real honor and privilege.  Just Correct continues to be one of my favorite career projects.  He was blessed with so much including his wife and kids.  Ralphie will be sorely missed by millions. 

Ralphie wanted to shoot his performance 4 times.  Generally, the (6) camera packages, we provided shooting once through is really enough.  Four is a bit over the top but to his credit, I'm so glad we did.  It gave me the front row of his show 3 times I was able to be a fan watching:-) and every time I did, it felt like laughing for the first time for his humor.  This Television Special followed the completion of season 1 for Last Comic Standing, a comedy series based on an earlier creation of my own titled National Lampoon's Collegiate Comedy Pop Off.  I enjoyed directing this project very much. I felt it was an outstanding show and Ralphie kills every time. Thanks, Ralphie, you will always be remembered.

A bit of trivia:  National Lampoon's Collegiate Comedy Pop Off was the first stand up comedy competition ever to be on television making it the first Reality Show years before it was labeled as a new genre.  It's on the record as the first.  I'm sure one day when my grandchildren are watching something on TV, this will be acknowledged as such.  Of course, only after my passing (damn those folks).

China is using the debts it is owed by other countries to purchase or invest in strategically located ports around the world on terms favorable to Beijing. The country is investing in ports located near U.S. military bases in places like in Djibouti, countries like Israel and Greece, which are traditional U.S. allies, and, increasingly, in Latin America.

Health and Fitness are the foundations of human life. Our body functions best when it is physically conditioned for exercise and our mind functions best when it receives the nutrition it needs. Sleep, Water, Sugar and Exercise are the pillars of life. 

To achieve a healthy, lean and fit body, follow a vegan high carb low fat diet and get a bike. 

Consumer 2500+ calories DAILY. Every cell in the human body runs on sugar/carbohydrate.

If you gain weight on this lifestyle, it is because you are recovering from metabolic damage. Everyone who stays on this lifestyle long term will get lean.

Cycling is the best sport for leaning out and getting fit. Get a decent road bike. Get a proper fit on your road bike. Ride at talking pace.

Through following teachings of books such as the Food Revolution, Skinny Bitch, 80-10-10, born to run, The China Study, The Pleasure Trap, Carb the Fuck up,  Go Fruit Yourself, etc.. From People like Durianrider, Freelee, Dr. McDougall..  I've learned many truths about health and fitness that are hidden from the public eye.","Obesity is a Choice"

About the album:
Even Worse is the fifth studio album by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, released on April 12, 1988. The album was produced by former The McCoys guitarist, Rick Derringer. The music on Even Worse is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies while the other is original material, featuring many ""style parodies"" or musical imitations.

 Chaotic days  and also  hectic nights:  That has time to cook? That's why  much of us  rely upon the grab-and-go  convenience of  refined foods.

There's a downside, though. These  dishes are  commonly high in fat, salt,  as well as sugar--  as well as low in nutrients that are good for you such as calcium, omega-3  fats, and fiber.
Yet, you can  function a better  diet plan into your packed  timetable if you  go shopping  wise  and also  maintain good-for-you foods  helpful.


Some nutritionists recommend  staying clear of certain aisles in the supermarket. Bypass rows with  pastry shop  things,  biscuits, cookies,  and also  various other foods high in saturated fat.

 As a whole, avoid  products if  any one of these  points appear high on the food label's  active ingredient list:

Trans fats: These  misbehave for you  as well as can be found in packaged  treats such as  breads, cookies,  biscuits,  and also some  kinds of margarine. Read the  nourishment facts to see all the fats in the product.

Other foods that are  commonly filled with trans fats: biscuits, breakfast sandwiches, microwave  snacks, cream-filled candy, doughnuts, fried fast foods,  and also frozen pizza.

Description:

Please don't eat your poop. Fecal matter transplantation has been documented dating back to 4th century china where traditional Chinese medicine practitioners would administer fecal suspensions by mouth (I know, gross). They would creatively term this suspension yellow soup and use it to treat severe diarrhea and food poisoning. Amazingly, today there is theory behind this practice. In modern days we have evolved a fascinating understanding of the gut microbiome, a collective of bacteria and other micro-organisms which we support in return for their loyal servitude. Our poop naturally flows through our guts and carries out with it a representative sample of these gut bacteria. When gut bacteria demographics turn nasty the micro-organisms that can be attained from healthy stool may serve as a vital key for future interventions. Fecal matter transplants or FMT is a fascinating general technique of modifying and tailoring the gut microbiome for the betterment of health and the defense against disease.

A 300 kilogram (47 stone/661 pound) man shocked doctors when he was rushed to hospital in China. Sun Liang, who is just 22-years-old, became ill last week and couldn't move himself in his own home. When an ambulance arrived at his house, paramedics were unable to move him on to a stretcher, so a dozen security men were sent to help shift him. Sun's doctor said he was unconscious and hardly breathing. The 22-year-old was over six kilograms and a half when he was born, and his appetite increased gradually as he grew up. Sun's doctor said Sun may live a long life if only he could reduce his weight by more than half. Report by Claire Lomas.

Obesity is a growing problem in Thailand. As the country becomes more affluent, its citizens are working more and cooking less which means that they are buying more convenience foods containing high levels of fat and sugar. In the Thai population at large, one in three men is obese but the numbers are worse in Thai temples where one in two Buddhist monks is obese. They eat the same food as the Thai population and they only eat in the mornings so what is the problem? Sucheera Maguire has been to Bangkok to talk to those who give and receive alms and she takes a look at some of the ingenious solutions that Thai nutritionists have come up with to combat the obesity crisis in Thai temples.","Obesity Crisis In Thai Temples.

Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

But there are certain dishes you'll want to avoid there, whether because you have allergies, or because you're counting your calories, or because some of them just aren't as good as you'd hoped.

If you've ever tried the Beijing Beef entree at Panda Express, you probably know it's almost as delicious as the famous Orange Chicken, and a lot of that has to do with its ingredients. It's a mixture of crispy beef, red bell peppers, and onions all mixed up in a sweet and tangy sauce. Sounds delicious, right?

But what's not delicious is the wildly high fat content in this dish. It comes in at 26 grams of fat for one serving, 5 grams of which are saturated. That's a significant chunk of the typical daily recommended total of 13 grams of saturated fat per day. According to the American Heart Association, it's recommended that consumers keep their consumption of saturated fat as low as possible, as it can lead to heart disease and high cholesterol. With almost half of the daily recommended amount in this dish, is that fried beef really worth it

Watch the video to learn about more Panda Express menu items you should avoid like the plague!

A growing number of people in the US are seeking food handouts as the nation’s Covid-19 cases continue to rise. The Meadowlands YMCA in the state of New Jersey has partnered with a local food bank and other organisations to help people in need. Many of those seeking free food were struggling because they have lost jobs amid the pandemic. YMCA officials said the organisation’s resources are stretched, and they often run out of supplies on food-distribution days.

Red Yeast Rice is a unique natural product native to China, that's been used in Asian traditional medical systems since approximately 800 A.D. Produced by fermenting red yeast (Monascus purpureus) with white rice. Red Yeast Rice is commonly used in cooking applications to enhance the color and flavor of foods. Peking Duck is an example of the coloration and flavor imparted by Red Yeast Rice. NOW® Red Yeast Rice Extract is carefully produced to avoid the presence of citrinin, a sometimes toxic by-product of the fermentation process.

1. 2823 cases are confirmed and 81 people dead. Patients who have heart attacks, obesity are more difficult to get recovery. Today another 12 medical staff, 1600 doctors and nurses go to Wuhan and support them. 

2. In the last video I said that 290 k ppl left Wuhan but today I saw the official video from Wuhan mayor and he admitted it’s 5 million ppl left. Unfortunately, I didn’t find the specific period for this number but according to 2018 statistics, 2.5 million ppl left the city during the spring festival. I was really pissed that the Wuhan government didn’t tell the truth in the beginning and they tried to hide it.  Some of them even said it wouldn’t affect ppl 2-3 weeks ago. My friend yang was working in Sri Lanka Kane she said if she knows that it will infect among people, she won’t come back. Before all news said coronavirus won’t infect kids and young people but actually there was a 36 old man died and one 9 months old baby got infected. 

3. Internationally, lots of pharmacies offer free masks in Japan.  Japan unofficial organization donated 1 million mouth masks to Wuhan. Thailand void visa expiration penalty for Hubei citizens as Hubei airports are closed at the moment. while Taiwan forbids all masks factories to export masks to the mainland. Korean restricted Chinese to enter Korean convenient stores. Sincerely thanks to Japan and Thailand and I hope I get a chance to visit these countries in the future. 

4. All airport shuttle buses in Shanghai are canceled. Free cancellation or changing for all ferry companies and over 50+airlines. But most are Asian airlines. 

5. To be honest, I am a bit horrified. For example, although in Shanghai only 50 cases are confirmed and we know where they are, when I hear my neighbors sneezing or coughing，I really want to close my window 

6. You know wechat? Now we can report suspected cases through wechat. 

7. Since we don’t go outside, I only walked 200 steps these days. I thought it’s a good time for me to study etc, but my internet becomes super slow. So basically I sleep and eat every day 

8. A bit of discrimination. Now when I hear ppl from Hubei or Wuhan, I assume that ppl have higher chances to get infected and I will definitely stay away but maybe that person is Wuhan citizen and doesn’t go back for several months. Just imagine when I go to Sweden, ppl will assume the same thing because I am from China or I have an Asian face although I believe I am super healthy. 


If you like my video, give me a like, leave comments, subscribe to my channel and share it with your friends. If you don’t like it, just close it. DON’T press “dislike”. I hate “dislike” just like a pig hates to be bacon.","Covid-19/ Coronavirus Outbreak in China, Jan.27, 2020"

Mental health is finally having a moment in the national conversation, but insurance companies, like Blue Cross and UnitedHealth, are finding ways to deny mental health treatment to thousands of patients. Hasan talks about his own experience with mental health therapy and shines a spotlight on the fight to bridge the disparity in treatment between mental and physical health.

The report, called ""F as in Fat: How Obesity Threatens American's Future 2010,"" shows that 44 percent of adult blacks in the Badger State are obese. The rate for whites is 26 percent, and for Hispanics it is 24.9 percent.
Nationally, the obesity rate for blacks and Hispanics is higher in 40 states than it is for whites. And nine states have an obesity rate for black adults above 40 percent.
The ratings are based on a three-year average of data culled from 2007-2009 by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
State Health Officer Seth Foldy, administrator for the division of public health in the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the racial and ethnic disparity in obesity rates in the state reflects differences in other health indicators, including mortality, smoking and teen pregnancy.
""It is a broad-based problem,"" Foldy said. ""One response to this has been making (elimination of) racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes a priority. One of the issues is the extent to which economic and social disadvantage"" is a factor. ""In general, Wisconsin is a prosperous and middle-class state, but African Americans are concentrated in high-poverty communities.""
Overall, Wisconsin is tied for 24th with Alaska in state obesity rankings, with 27 percent of the states' adults being obese. Wisconsin ranks 43rd in obesity among Hispanics.
Wisconsin, the report says, lags behind other states in implementing policies to address obesity. For example:

•Wisconsin is not among the 20 states and the District of Columbia that have set stricter nutritional standards than the federal government for school breakfasts, lunches and snacks.

•Wisconsin is not among the 28 states and the District of Columbia that have nutritional standards for competitive foods sold in vending machines, school stores or at school bake sales.

•Wisconsin is not among 20 states that require children and adolescents undergo body mass index screenings or some other form of weight assessments in school.

As the world awaits news on the whereabouts of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, much attention had been focused on the founding anniversary of the regime's armed forces today. 
However, the North Korean leader still remained out of public sight.
Our Kim Mok-yeon has more details.
On Saturday, the 88th anniversary of the birth of the North Korean People's Revolutionary Army, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stayed out of public sight.
Amid rumors surrounding the health of the North Korean leader, there was much speculation if he would show up for the occasion.  
But North Korean media outlets focused reporting on the anniversary and its background without mentioning the leader's whereabouts.
Also today, Reuters, quoting three anonymous sources familiar with the situation, reported that China had dispatched a team of medical personnel to North Korea to quote ""advise on"" Kim.
According to the report, the delegation, led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department, left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday.
The Chinese government has yet to confirm the news. 
For the past week, the world has been awaiting news about Kim, as he remained out of public sight for the past two weeks, even on his grandfather Kim Il-sung's birthday on April 15th.
And with an earlier report from Daily NK, a South Korean news outlet focusing on North Korea issues, that Kim was receiving medical treatment after a cardiovascular procedure, and reports from CNN claiming that Kim could be in critical condition, speculation has been raised about the North Korean leader's health condition.
Pundits have pointed to Kim's heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems as possible sources of health problems.
However, the truth behind the North Korean leader's whereabouts remains to be seen as South Korea's Blue House claimed that there was no evidence to suggest Kim was sick, and that he appeared to be working as usual with close officials near the eastern province of Wonsan.

Italy scrambles to contain coronavirus outbreak after admitting hospital mess-up
By Angela Dewan, Sharon Braithwaite and Nicola Ruotolo, CNN

Updated 1728 GMT (0128 HKT) February 25, 202
Milan, Italy (CNN)Italian authorities were on the defensive Tuesday as they faced tough questions over the country's handling of the novel coronavirus, which is rapidly spreading across the country's northern regions.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has tried to allay fears that the central government has no control over the affected regions after he was forced to admit that a hospital in the northern town of Codogno had mishandled the region's first coronavirus case and had contributed to the deadly virus' spread.
Italy now has the highest number of coronavirus infections outside Asia, as 54 new cases were detected in the country's north overnight, bringing the total to 283, the Italian civil protection agency said Tuesday.
The cases are heavily concentrated in the region of Lombardy where 212 infections have been confirmed. Seven people have so far died from the virus in the country.
&quot;Our health system is excellent, our precautionary measures are of the utmost rigor and we trust that, by virtue of the combined provisions ... we will promote a containment effect,&quot; Conte told reporters on Tuesday.

UAE halts all Iran flights over coronavirus outbreak
Flight ban comes after Kuwait and Bahrain report coronavirus cases in people returning from Iran.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has suspended all flights to and from Iran for at least a week over the outbreak of the new coronavirus after its spread was announced across multiple Middle East nations from the Islamic Republic.

The UAE, home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, remains a key international transit route for Iran's 80 million people.

Military hospital launches 5G teleconsultation to support Wuhan's epidemic battle
Source: Xinhua| 2020-02-10 21:09:22|Editor: huaxia
BEIJING, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital carried out 5G teleconsultation services Sunday with Huoshenshan Hospital, a recently built makeshift hospital in Wuhan, to battle the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak.

The teleconsultation also marks the launching of the teleconsultation system between the two hospitals.

Supported by the 5G network, the system enables doctors in Beijing to establish real-time communications with those in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in central China's Hubei Province.

Experts of the Chinese PLA General Hospital will be kept on standby to offer high-quality medical services to patients in Wuhan, the hospital said.
-----------------------
5G holds an agenda for total control. It is stated that when it is introduced in 2020, it can be used for “anything, anywhere, anytime in an unlimited manner”. I am all for digital progress but not at the expense of having an adverse impact on human and environmental health.

It is not my intention to go into the merits that 5G violates human rights and informed consent. My interest, as a family doctor and a representative of the people, is society’s well-being.

We live in a society whose quality of life and health is being drastically affected by air, water and land pollutants, which are man induced.

One such pollutant, which we do take for granted, is the accumulation of artificial electromagnetic fields that at times reach the thresholds of an electrosmog. It is an established fact that electromagnetic radiation (EMR) has increased by tenfold on the top of the background, natural EMR. 

I often ask myself: are we playing Russian roulette each time we use our cellular phone? For US Attorney Jimmy Gonzalez it definitely was the case.

He used to hold his cellular phone with his left hand on the left side of his ear and he developed a tumour in his left hand, a gliobastoma on the left side of his head and an aortic tumour because he held the cellular phone inside his jacket pocket.

Who knows, I may have developed prostate cancer early in life not only because I am genetically predisposed but because I used to hold my cellular phone in my trousers pocket or on my car seat very close to me while driving. Non-native EMR may have been the triggering factor.

17. Uribe with a little boy, unwrapping his present - a frying pan
STORYLINE
Manuel Uribe, who once weighed half a ton but has now slimmed down to around 310 kilograms (700 pounds), celebrated his 43rd birthday on Wednesday with a simple wish for the coming year: to be able to stand on his own two feet to get married.
Interviewed at his home in northern Mexico, where he can still do little more than sit up in bed, Uribe said that over two years of steady dieting has helped him lose around 250 kilos (550 pounds) from his Guinness record weight of 560 kilos (1,235 lbs).
""A man that was about to die weighing almost 600 kilograms or more - because I weighed more than 600 kilograms, but only 560 (kilos) registered.
So, the Guinness World Record gave me the title of ""The Fattest man in the world,"" said Uribe.
But although he may have shed more pounds than any person in the history of weight loss, Uribe is still unable to walk his fiancee, Claudia Solis, down the aisle.
Yet, Uribe says he is content to live with what he has.
""Thanks to God I have learned to be happy with what I have at this moment.  What I have is my life, this body.""
When Uribe decided to attend an outdoor party in March - a rare outing to celebrate Claudia's 38th birthday - it was complicated by the fact he hasn't been able to get out of bed for the last six years.
So a flatbed tow truck was found to move his specially reinforced bed down a road to the outing, but it got caught in an underpass and he had to turn back.
The couple met four years ago and have been romantically involved for the last two years. 
""In the eyes of God, we are already married,"" Uribe says.
Proudly showing off her sparkling engagement ring, Solis, a 38-year-old hairdresser, acknowledged life with the world's fattest man was not always easy.
Her first husband, who was also obese, died of respiratory failure and she said her family were initially against the match with Uribe.
Uribe, a former autoparts dealer, said his birthday party will be low key.
Just over two years ago, a team of doctors offered to help him change his eating habits and tackle his extreme obesity.

SUMMARY
Ryosuke called it a long-breath diet. The technique consists of assuming a certain position, taking a three-second breath, and then a strong seven-second exhalation.
Most European doctors support the use of breathing exercises for weight loss and explain their effectiveness as follows: fat consists of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. When the oxygen you breathe in reaches the fat cells, it splits them into carbon and water. 

THE INSTRUCTION:
• First, stand up, and push one leg forward and the other back.
• Now strain your buttocks and transfer your weight to your back foot. Yes, just like this.
• Slowly start inhaling for 3 seconds, lifting your arms above your head.
• Then exhale forcefully for 7 seconds, straining all your body muscles.
Perform this exercise every day for 2 to10 minutes.

If you’ve already tried this exercise, don’t forget to share your experience in the comments below!

According to traditional Chinese medicine, you can encourage the weight loss process if you let excess “moisture” and “heat” leave your body. However, don't take these words literally! Expelling extra “heat” and “moisture” means that when you stimulate certain points, you get rid of energy imbalance and set off your metabolism. In addition, by doing so, you support the health of your digestive organs.

SUMMARY:
- One of the most important acupressure points responsible for weight loss is GV 26. It's situated on your upper lip right under your nose.
- The second acupressure point that can help you lose weight is located on your elbow. It's called LI 11. When you massage this place, you stimulate your intestinal function and remove excess moisture from your body.
- The third point point is located approximately an inch below your belly button. Massage it up and down for one to 2 minutes twice a day. This method will help make your digestion better.
- Abdominal sorrow points are situated slightly below your bottom ribs. Press these points with the index and middle fingers of each hand simultaneously. This will help if you have indigestion, rib pain, ulcers, or an appetite imbalance.
- You can find one more point on the inner side of your leg, a bit higher than your ankle. Use your thumbs to apply pressure here. Try to do this exercise every day. You'll soon notice that your digestive system has become stronger and started to function more effectively.
- You'll find the knee point approximately 2” beneath your kneecap. It's situated slightly off-center, closer to the outer side of your leg. For losing unwanted weight, press this point for one to 2 minutes a day with the help of your index finger
- The pressure you apply to the ear point should be constant and neither too strong nor too weak. Keep pressing the point for approximately 3 minutes. This will help you control your hunger urges and appetite. On top of that, it will improve your digestion.
- The best environment for stimulating acupressure points is a calm and tranquil place, but this isn't an obligatory condition.
- Acupressure can't work its magic if you lead an unhealthy lifestyle. Try to combine this Chinese approach with physical activity and a proper diet.

When Ania and Vlad married they were impoverished students living in Moscow, surviving on love alone. Now five years on, they both have prestigious jobs and live in a nice flat. Although Vlad gives Ania expensive gifts and treats her to exotic holidays, she believes that their feelings towards each other have died, and so she leaves for Kiev on the pretence of a business trip but actually to put some distance between them while sorting out her feelings. Ania finds Kiev in May a romantic city - with dazzling spring colours, blooming chestnut trees, the intoxicating smell of lilac, cobbled streets offering romantic walks and a handsome young photographer whom she keeps bumping into. They become acquainted and soon find they have a lot in common. Ania fancies herself in love but when her husband comes to visit her in Kiev, Ania has to decide whether to plunge into a new romance or try to find new depths in her old relationship.

• Research suggests that 1 out of 3 adults has prediabetes. Of this group, 9 out of 10 don’t know they have it.
• 34.2 million people in the United States have diabetes, but 8.1 million may be undiagnosed and unaware of their condition.
• More than one in every 10 adults who are 20 years or older has diabetes. For seniors (65 years and older), that figure rises to more than one in four.
• Cases of diagnosed diabetes cost the United States an estimated $327 billion. This cost is expected to rise with the increasing diagnoses.

The class will cover:
• Understanding the Primary Cause of Type-2 Diabetes
• Dietary Intervention Trials / Studies
• Why a Plant-Based Diet for Diabetes
• Steps to Transition to a Plant-Based Diet for Type-2 Diabetes
• Nutrients in Plant Food & Calorie Density

SOUNDBITE: 
The effects of obesity, particularly in children, have been cause for concern in the West, but the problem has also struck some children in Georgia.
In the capital of Tbilisi, 15-month-old Luka Meliksishvili and five year old Georgiy Bibilauri are both heavily overweight. 
Luka was just three kilograms (6 pounds) when he was born but he now weighs 26 kilogrammes (57 pounds).
Lia Patsia, Luka's grandmother, told APTN that he was already to large for her to carry, but doctors have said there is nothing medically wrong with Luka. 
Bibilauri weighs 62 kilogrammes (136 pounds) but has become somewhat of a local celebrity known for his ability to wrestle, and is widely expected to win wrestling medals for Georgia in the future.

When COVID-19 hit, and it was apparent that specialized medical care was needed to keep many patients from dying, there was a sense of dread for what the pandemic would mean for populations without the means and infrastructure to provide that care. While the situation has been dire in many Central and South American countries, and is fast approaching critical in South Asia, the majority of African countries have remained largely, and mysteriously, un-scathed. Many reasons for this have been proposed: from younger demographics and fewer international exposures, to a simple lack of data and testing. Dr. Abbate will go through the bases for some of these theories, the biases that may influence them, and the challenges of comparing data across countries during a crisis. She will then share a set of initiatives to build collaborative solutions with partners both in-country and abroad to fill in those gaps and improve disease prevention and response decisions worldwide. 

Sigma Xi is an international, multidisciplinary research society whose programs and activities promote the health of the scientific enterprise and honor scientific achievement.

Why There Is Almost No Chinese people Who suffer from fatty liver and obesity and how you can use what This Man reveals to resolve your fatty liver
and Stay Slim Forever
Chinese Secrets To Fatty Liver And Obesity Reversal 
Respected reader,
Chinese Secrets To Fatty Liver And Obesity Reversal 
 
My name is Abe Hsieh and I have been a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine for over 37 years. And I have spent the last 25 years of tha time working solely on fatty liver, obesity and autoimmune disease.

 Why these conditions?

 Chinese Secrets To Fatty Liver And Obesity Reversal 

Because I felt that Chinese medicine and a way of life hides the solutions for the terrible conditions. The proof that this is the case is in the facts that these conditions are almost non-existent in China, especially fatty liver. I felt that it's a crime that the solution is right there in front of our eyes and nobody talks about it. Nobody asks the simple question ""Why Chinese don't get fatty liver"".
Chinese Secrets To Fatty Liver And Obesity Reversal 
 And this ia all happening while fatty liver is destroying the lives of millions of people. The western doctors are greatly underestimating the gravity of this condition. Your doctor might have told you that ""It's nothing to worry about, just loose some weight...""
I know that the fact that you are reading this means that you might be in panic that you will never get better and that you will just spend year after year waiting for death in the body you are not satisfied with and feeling like a wreck. But, allow me to say this - this is all due to the fact that you have never
addressed the underlying triggers, you have just addressed the
consequencesand with that approach you are right, there is a great chance
that you will never be able to resolve your fatty liver.

But the whole purpose of my work is to send the following message...

Relax - fatty liver is reversible in practically every case.","Chinese Secrets To Fatty Liver And Obesity Reversal"

Even though the Internet is considered a basic human right by the UN, many poor and rural communities across the country are still left with little to no access to broadband networks. This lack of Internet access then further impacts the ability of these communities to obtain healthcare, education, and other important necessities. While Internet service providers like Comcast and Charter are largely to blame for Internet inequality in parts of the country, the FCC is making things worse by siding with private corporations at the expense of millions of Americans who lack access to what has become a vital tool for everyday life. 

Since so many Americans lack access to streaming platforms like Netflix, we decided to put out a DVD version of this episode that can be rented at dvd.com/patriotact. Just don’t forget to mail it back when you are done with it.

DISCLAIMER - THIS PODCAST IS NOT MEANT TO BE MEDICAL ADVICE. IT IS AN OPEN DISCUSSION TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THIS TOPIC.

There are many reasons why a whole food plant based diet may be helpful for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Data suggest limiting omega-6 PUFAs (ie oils), saturated fats, animal protein, and food additives may be associated with a reduced risk of developing IBD. A whole food plant based diet seems to check all of those boxes. However, this doesn’t change the fact that there are some out there who respond to the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (which is a monosaccharide diet) that does not restrict meat, cheese or cooking oils. Enthusiasm for a whole food plant based diet is gaining steam not just for IBD but also other health conditions like heart disease, obesity, diabetes and prevention of cancer. It’s important to remember that there still is a lot of controversy regarding what is the optimal diet for human health if such a thing exists. Today I interviewed Shamiz and Shukul Kachwalla who are brothers who run High Carb Health and promote a whole food plant based diet. Shamiz has ulcerative colitis and has been maintaining drug free remission with a whole food plant based diet for over seven years. As a disclaimer, this podcast should not be interpreted as medical advice and is not an official endorsement of this diet for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease especially without appropriate medical therapy.

People with NAFLD also had a longer viral shedding period after admission to hospital (17 vs 12 days), suggesting that the condition increases the duration of infectiousness.
Multivariate analysis showed that people with NAFLD were at least six times more likely to progress and underlying co-morbidity was associated with a similar increase in risk. Male sex and age over 60 years were also associated with progression.
NAFLD was also associated with a higher frequency of liver injury (abnormal liver function during hospitalisation) (70% vs 11%)
NAFLD may promote a pro-inflammatory environment in the liver, impairing innate immunity and leading to more severe COVID-19 illness.

Thirty years of rising living standards have left Qatar with an epidemic of obese children. Now doctors are trying to tighten belts and stem the tide on a major health problem that could have far reaching consequences.

At the beginning I was fine, until I was in the third year at primary school. Then the Gulf tummy started to grow explains Moaz, who suffered from obesity all through his childhood. A sharp rise in economic affluence, increasingly westernized diets and low exercise rates has lead to an explosion in the country's levels of obesity. 40% of Qataris are now obese and 20% suffer from diabetes, with 75% of diabetics under 45 years of age. As Dr Taheri explains, the effects could be far reaching. ""They are going to be affected at a very young age with heart disease, problems with cancer, dementia, things that are going to affect the nation in the long term."" Doctors like Taheri are hoping that a strict program of prevention, enforcing healthy diets and exercise regimes upon the nation's schoolchildren will be enough to limit the impact.

New Delhi, Nov 17 (ANI): New research from the University of South Australia shows that excess egg consumption can increase your risk of diabetes. Conducted in partnership with the China Medical University, and Qatar University, the longitudinal study (1991 to 2009) is the first to assess egg consumption in a large sample of Chinese adults. It found that people who regularly consumed one or more eggs per day (equivalent to 50 grams) increased their risk of diabetes by 60 per cent. With the prevalence of diabetes in China now exceeding 11 per cent - above that of the global average of 8.5 per cent - diabetes has become a serious public health concern. The economic impact of diabetes is also significant, accounting for 10 per cent of global health expenditure (USD $760 billion). In China, diabetes-related costs have exceeded USD USD109 billion. Epidemiologist and public health expert, UniSA's Dr Ming Li, says the rise of diabetes is a growing concern, especially in China where changes to the traditional Chinese diet are impacting health.

We failed – there are more Africans living in extreme poverty today than ever before. Shot in high definition, Africa Rising goes right inside the extraordinary story of how a large rural area of Ethiopia is taking itself out of poverty. With a cast of thousands, our film will open the eyes of the world to a new dawn of Africans solving Africa’s needs themselves.

In a controversial, colourful and frequently uplifting one-hour documentary, we highlight the failure of Western policies towards Africa, asking whether it's time to reconsider the role of Western aid workers on the continent.

The obesity epidemic has spread to the Third World and it is likely 1 billion people will be obese by 2030. So how did it explode in places that, not so long ago, counted malnutrition and even famine as major concerns? Well it's mostly about the aggressive marketing and low prices of Western fast food. As globalisation and a little more money open up Third World markets, the first to step in are the likes of McDonalds and Coke. In this global production, we travel to China where the consumption of sugar and oil has sent the national scales spinning; to Brazil where global food companies have fundamentally altered traditional diets; to India where it's predicted 100 million people will soon be suffering diabetes and on to Mexico, where the weight problem is so pressing, stomach reduction surgery is offered for free. The diagnosis is stark: ""No country has managed the transition to get rid of hunger without it shifting to obesity"" says anti-obesity crusader Barry Popkin. In a world where we are bombarded with messages to eat more hundreds of times a day, it's clear that obesity is a ticking time bomb.","Globesity: Fat's New Frontier"

 Best Yoga Poses For MIGRAINE HEADACHE PAIN RELIEF.
 Yoga is not only a holistic approach to getting your body relieved from pains, but it also makes your body stronger to fight other illnesses as they make their ways close to you. Yoga is as much effective in combating #migraines as it is in fighting any other pain. Specific yoga poses can target tension and #stress, which may be contributing to your #headaches.
 
 You can switch to yoga along with your regular medication for migraines. Yoga can provide more than just physical fitness. It assists your body and mind to relax and calm, also helps fight #anxiety and depression. 
 
 Yoga is an ancient practice, whose practitioners consider it to be more than just a form of exercise. It promotes a sense of holistic living through the combination of breathing techniques and asanas. It has no side effects. It helps battle ailments while correcting postures, energy flow, and overall health. All it takes is a few minutes of your time to practice yoga every day and keep problems like a migraine at bay.
 
 Migraines are more intense than frequent headaches. Theyâ€™re typically characterized by a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Theyâ€™re often accompanied by nausea, dizziness, and sensitivity to light and sound. Migraines can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days.
 
 # So here are a few poses to help you fight a migraine attack.
 
 #PADMASANA (LOTUS POSE YOGA)
 The Padmasana or the Lotus Pose is a meditative posture that relaxes the mind and clears out the head, thereby reducing the headaches. Donâ€™t be deceived by how simple it looks, though. It can be quite a task to master this sitting pose.
 
 To do this pose, sit on the floor with your legs stretched out. Now bend your right knee and place the foot on the left thigh. Now bend your left knee and place the foot on the right thigh. Make sure your heels point upward and are close to the abdomen. Hold for a few seconds. 
 
 #HASTAUTTANASANA YOGA (HAND RAISING POSE)
 Hasta uttanasana or Hand raising pose helps you stretch your body and increases blood circulation. It enhances the amount of oxygen in the head and releases stress, thereby, reducing the pain.
 
 Stand erect and raise both the hands above the head. Let there be shoulders length between the two arms. Bend the trunk and head backward to create a slight curve. Raising the arms and bending the trunk backward is done at the same time. Breathe in deeply while raising the arms.
 
 #MARJARIASANA (YOGA CAT STRETCH POSE)
 Marjariasana or The Cat Stretch is a great mind and muscle relaxant. It also improves your breathing and allows you to release stress. All of these factors help in getting rid of the pain and symptoms of a migraine.
 
 Come down on your hands and knees. While inhaling, suppress your back and raise your head up. Hold for a few seconds and then exhale while arching your back and pulling in your belly. Repeat for ten times and then relax. 
 
 #PASCHIMOTTANASANA (SEATED FORWARD BEND POSE)
 Paschimottanasana or Seated forward bend pumps a new lot of blood to your head. It ensures the absorption of more nutrients, and fresh oxygen in the head, which automatically reduces the pain. The asana also works on the digestive system. So if your headache is stomach related, you will find relief instantly.
 
 Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out. Now slowly bend forward and try to press your big toes with your fingers. Hold for a few seconds and then relax. 
 
 #SHAVASANA (CORPSE POSE)
 The Shavasana or the Corpse Pose is the ultimate climax to a great yoga session. 
 
 It brings about a deep state of rest in the body. 
 The body almost drifts into a meditative state and gets rejuvenated. This rejuvenation also helps in banishing migraines.
 
Lay on your back with your hands away from body and palms facing upward. Feet should be hip-width apart. Keep your neck and back straight and relax for a few seconds. 
 
Practice these poses daily and see a remarkable relief in your suffering from a migraine.

In New York, one of many US states where fatty and conveniently cheap fast food restaurant chains are a major cause for the country's giant obesity rates - organisations are using various ways to make healthy meals more accessible to the public.

Experts say the government must subsidise healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, instead of popular fast food companies, to better combat the problem.

Crew and Macy’s that are shrinking their brick-and-mortar operations.

But one retailer — Dollar General — is doing just the opposite.

The discount store has opened more stores than ever before, with more than 5,000 new locations across the U.S. since 2010. It now has more than 14 thousand stores in the country — or just about as many as McDonald’s.

It's opening up stores in parts of the country that were slow to rebound from the recession —low income, rural communities that larger retailers won't touch — and they're making a lot of money doing it.

VICE News traveled to Kansas, where the rise of the discount store has spurred the fall of another, arguably more crucial type of establishment: small, local grocery stores.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Fat Bastard (Mike Myers) makes a surprisingly heartfelt admission.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Austin Powers -- fashion photographer, denizen of Swingin' London, international espionage agent, and bane of dental hygienists everywhere -- returns in his second screen adventure. Powers (once again played by Mike Myers), a 1960s superspy stranded in the 1990s, discovers that his nemesis, criminal genius Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), has somehow stolen his ""mojo"" (the secret to his otherwise inexplicable sex appeal) and traveled back in time to the 1960s as part of his latest fiendish scheme. Powers must also travel back in time to retrieve it, but if Austin doesn't quite fit into 1998, he's been there just long enough not to fit in in 1968 anymore, either. Powers also discovers that Dr. Evil has new allies this time: Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a clone of Dr. Evil one-eighth his size but just as nasty; Fat Bastard (Myers yet again), whose name describes him just fine; and vixenish assassin Robin Swallows (Gia Carides). Powers' lack of mojo also proves troublesome when he's paired with his new partner, saucy CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Other characters returning from the first film include Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Seth Green as Scott Evil, and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me also includes cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Jerry Springer, Woody Harrelson, and Burt Bacharach with his current songwriting partner, Elvis Costello.

In this episode, Michael Osterholm, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and author of Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs, provides an overview on the COVID-19 pandemic in regards to what has happened to date, what we’ve learned about how the disease spreads, and his optimism and pessimism about what potentially lies ahead. Michael gives his take on the true case fatality rate, why it differs around the world, and which underlying conditions, such as obesity, impact risk of severe illness and death. We also discuss the outlook regarding vaccines, repurposed drugs/antivirals for treatment, and Michael’s growing concern about supply chain limitations with respect to drugs, vaccines, n95 masks, and testing kits.

We discuss:
-Recapping the brief history of COVID-19 and what potentially lies ahead [2:15];
-Some positive news about immunity and reinfection [10:45];
-Case fatality rate—the challenge in finding the true rate, difference by country, and the impact of age, underlying conditions, and obesity [13:00];
-What has to be true for less than 100,000 Americans to die from COVID-19? [24:30];
-How do we best protect healthcare workers? [29:45];
-Concerns about testing capability—reagent shortfall and a supply chain problem [39:30];
-Vaccines and antivirals—The outlook, timing, and challenges [47:45];
-Long term health of survivors of COVID-19 [56:45];
-The impact of comorbidities—Diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppressed patients [59:30];
-Understanding R0 and how the disease spreads [1:01:30];
-The challenge of forecasting with so many unknowns [1:08:00];
-What explains the difference in cases and fatalities in different parts of the world? [1:14:30];
-Repurposed drugs/antivirals being considered for treatment options—any optimism? [1:16:45];
-A parting message from Michael about what lies ahead [1:18:30]; and
-More.

Biography:
Almost a decade into his career, San Diego-based rapper Ruslan is Christian hip hop’s jack of all trades. When he isn’t writing and producing original music, he develops compelling content on Youtube, mentors up-and-coming artists, and runs his own independent label, Kings Dream Entertainment. 
 
Born Ruslan Karaoglanov to Armenian parents in Baku, Azerbaijan, Ruslan was a child when he immigrated with his family to the United States in 1991 to escape religious persecution after an ethnic conflict broke out in the wake of tensions between the dissolving Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan government. Settling in San Diego, Ruslan became interested in hip-hop around age eight, and has been honing his craft ever since. In 2010 he released Right Out Loud (The Prequel EP), followed by his full-length debut, Carry On, in 2013. Around the same time, he formed the collective Dream Junkies with fellow rappers Beleaf and John Givez. The group’s debut album, 2016’s Good Religion, registered on Billboard’s R&B, rap, independent, and Heatseakers charts. In 2017 he released part one of his Indie Jones mixtape series which garnered attention on Youtube from the likes of Gary Vaynerchuk and Chase Jarvis.
 
On Indie Jones III, the self-produced third installment in the series. This time around, he gives listeners a glimpse of the man behind the music, discussing his upbringing, his family, his work ethic, his faith, and more.","Reacting to Joe Rogan's Dr. Osterholm Coronavirus Interview (How Obesity is More Deadly)"

Katz, and Timothy Noakes share insights that are certain to challenge the status quo.

Carb-Loaded: A Culture Dying to Eat is a chronicle of the things it's writer and director Lathe Poland learned after he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. He sought to find out why he got sick, because he didn't fit the classic picture of an adult onset diabetes sufferer. He quickly learned that much of what he knew about healthy eating was based on myths or fifty year old science. In the film he searches out why Americas modern food culture is killing us. The upside? There is a lot that can be done!

*** Observe: This treatment is extremely effective. If you have diabetes and take blood sugar lowering medication (especially insulin injections) you may need to reduce the doses a lot to avoid potentially dangerous hypoglycemia. You may instantly become too healthy for your medication. ***

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqDTJogdWmA","On the Sea Islands along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia, a painful chapter of American history is playing out again. These islands are home to the Gullah or Geechee people, the descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to work at the plantations that once ran down the southern Atlantic coast. After the Civil War, many former slaves on the Sea Islands bought portions of the land where their descendants have lived and farmed for generations. That property, much of it undeveloped waterfront land, is now some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

But the Gullah are now discovering that land ownership on the Sea Islands isn’t quite what it seemed. Local landowners are struggling to hold on to their ancestral land as resort developers with deep pockets exploit obscure legal loopholes to force the property into court-mandated auctions. These tactics have successfully fueled a tourism boom that now attracts more than 2 million visitors a year. Gullah communities have all but disappeared, replaced by upscale resorts and opulent gated developments that new locals — golfers, tourists, and mostly white retirees —  fondly call “plantations.”

Faced with an epic case of déjà vu, the Gullah are scrambling for solutions as their livelihood and culture vanish, one waterfront mansion at a time.

Japanese companies moving operations from China to India or Bangladesh will be subsidized by the government
Japan has a policy to support enterprises in this country moving production from China to India or Bangladesh.
This is one of the expansion programs of the Government of Japan to diversify the supply chain in the country.
Since the relationship between the US and China fell into tension leading to the outbreak of trade war, | When the world experiences the COVID-19 pandemic with many fluctuations, countries around the world tend to ""escape"" investment from China, including Japan.
According to the Nikkei Asian Review, the Japanese government spends 220 billion yen ($ 2 billion) in the additional budget of fiscal year 2020 to encourage companies to relocate factories to Japan and some other countries. Of that amount, 23.5 billion yen (US $ 220 million) was used to assist businesses moving factories from China to Southeast Asia.
The diversified supply chain program announced by Japan in July has supported more than 10 billion yen for 30 companies specializing in manufacturing from China to Southeast Asia. For example, Hoya company specializes in manufacturing electronic components for Vietnam and Laos. Another 57 Japanese companies are being helped by the Government of Japan to specialize in production facilities.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on September 3 conducted the second round of this supply chain diversification program.
Accordingly, projects that contribute to the recovery of the Japan - ASEAN supply chain, especially the project to move factories to India or Bangladesh, will also be on the list of companies supported by the Government of Japan. .
On that basis, the feasibility studies and the pilot programs will also receive subsidies from the Government. The total amount is expected to reach tens of millions of dollars.
The Japanese government's diversified supply chain program this time aims to reduce dependence on some supply chain links, especially with China.
At the same time, the program wants to ensure the steady flow of products such as medical supplies and internal electronic components | Truong urgently.
This is a matter of primary concern as Japan just had to experience the Chinese shutdown in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the past, the policy of funding Japanese companies moving back to their home countries or moving to other Southeast Asian countries was met with opposition.
Some Japanese companies see China as a particularly important market, and relocating production would be costly and cause unnecessary disruption.
On the contrary, some Japanese companies in China are concerned about the imposition of tariffs in the future amid the trade war between the US and China.","Japan is crumbling the Chinese economy by moving companies from China to India"

https://youtu.be/01QQWQGGFoI


Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat addition that may ruin health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).
Adults
For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:
• Overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and
• Obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.


What causes obesity and overweight?
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been:
• an increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat; and
• an increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.


Record numbers of Americans are obese, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
More than 70% of Americans are now either obese or overweight by this measure. However, the statistics are particularly worrying. Almost 40% of adults are obese. The childhood obesity rate, for ages 6-19, has increased to 20%.
Childhood obesity is linked to increased mortality rates in adulthood, and obesity can lead to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
It’s hardly a uniquely American problem though — the World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the number of obese kids and adolescents has risen tenfold over the last four decades, around the world.

Processed Foods Are Universal
Americans who are poor and obese don’t live in a food desert, they may live in an area where frozen corn dogs sold at the local dollar store are more affordable than fresh fruits and vegetables sold in a supermarket.
Nonstop Stress
From job insecurity and high unemployment to a dysfunctional health insurance system, life has becoming increasingly stressful in the U.S.—and research shows a strong link between stress and weight gain.
Poor Work/Life Balance
Seven Powerful Ideas That Influence the Way We Think has pointed out that obesity is one of the results of Americans’ poor work/life balance.
Lack of Universal Healthcare
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 has given millions of previously uninsured Americans access to health insurance. But millions of other Americans remain uninsured, and cut off from things that discourage obesity, such as programs promoting wealth loss or weight management. 
Powerful Junk Food Lobby
The lobby that’s doing the most to promote poor health may very well be the junk food lobby, which spends millions of dollars trying to influence policy in Washington, DC. 

WHO response
Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2004, the ""WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health"" describes the actions needed to support healthy diets and regular physical activity. The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.

MSNBC anchor Brian Williams stopped broadcasting the press conference just after a minute so he could fact check Trump’s claims on legal votes.

Age: 28
Height: 6'1""
Weight: 297 lbs

Imagine not leaving your house or seeing your friends for years. Imagine not bathing in nearly that long because your body had grown so enormous that it could no longer fit in the shower. Imagine looking down at the scale and seeing the number 653 staring back at you.

That's where Bodybuilding.com forum member Jesse Shand found himself in 2013. By then, he had given up on the idea of living a normal life—at least by society's definition of ""normal.""

""I spent my days playing video games and trolling the Internet,"" remembers Jesse. ""I was just all negativity, all of the time.""

Jesse's heaviest recorded weight was 653 pounds, but he probably weighed quite a bit more than that. He could only find a scale big enough to weigh himself with after losing weight for two months.

The only thing more remarkable about the amount of weight Jesse lost—300 pounds—is the way he lost it—through help from strangers on the Bodybuilding.com forums.

| 300 Pounds Down |
Remarkably, Jesse's transformation started by accident. ""It started off as nothing more than an ill-fated attempt to get a rise out of bodybuilding types,"" he recalls. Jesse created a thread called ""Ask the fattest man on the misc [sub-forum] anything,"" posted photos of his then-obese body, and waited, fully expecting—almost inviting—a backlash.

What happened instead set the wheels of change in motion.

""[My plan] 'backfired' on me, and people started to try to convince me that it wasn't too late, that even at my weight, all was not lost,"" remembers Jesse. ""I didn't want to hear it and made my usual excuses, like not having enough money for groceries or lacking the motivation. But the members of the thread didn't accept my excuses and even offered advice on how it could be done. They walked me through it, provided me with a platform to get feedback and take baby steps, and the rest is history!""

""It really showed me that even on the Internet, the kindness of strangers can completely change your life. It helped me to realize that I had something to fight for,"" Jesse says of his Bodybuilding.com comrades. ""They're the ones who took me under their wings and believed in me long before I believed in myself.""

The phrase ""be strong, be kind"" has become a government motto and her speeches and social media posts travel far beyond New Zealand, often going viral across the world. In an election last month, she easily secured a second term.

She does, though, have critics and some say that she is failing the young and impoverished. 

This year, the UN children's agency annual report on child wellbeing placed New Zealand 35th out of 41 countries surveyed. The report found that 13 percent of the country's children were living in “material hardship” -  defined as unable to eat fresh food, visit doctors or pay bills on time. Worst affected were Indigenous Maori and Pacifika households with nearly one in four Maori children and one in three Pacifika children living in poverty.  And New Zealand has the second worst youth suicide rate in the developed world. 

Ardern responded to the report by pointing out it had not taken into consideration the NZ$5.5bn ""Families Package"" which her government says has lifted 18,400 children out of poverty. 

So what is really going on in New Zealand and why are so many children being left behind? In this episode of The Stream, we will ask those questions to a panel of experts and find out how they think the issue should be tackled.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nJgHBbEgsE","Dr. Jason Fung, MD, is a nephrologist and expert in the use of intermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate diets for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. In this presentation, delivered on Aug. 2, 2018, at the 2018 CrossFit Health Conference in Madison, Wisconsin, Fung shares his first-hand experiences with “The Mess” and discusses how he shifted his research and medical practices as a result of those experiences.

Fung’s objectives for his presentation include:
1. Understanding why long-term weight loss is so difficult.
2. Introducing the concept of therapeutic fasting.
3. Understanding some myths and misunderstandings associated with the fasting process.

He recalls treating obese and diabetic patients with traditional methods, which included what he characterizes as poor dietary recommendations and a slurry of drugs. He explains, “It became obvious that I’m just sort of holding their hand until they get their heart attack, until they get dialysis, until they go blind, until we chop their feet off.”

“It’s really sad to realize that the profession that you’ve chosen is not really helping people,” he says. This realization compelled him to diagnose the problems associated with traditional care and seek alternative treatment methods for his patients.

Fung historicizes what he calls “the modern eating pattern,” which emerged in 1977 in the U.S. with the development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. He notes the 1977 guidelines led to the consumption of more grains and sugars, which in turn led to people “eating often, eating late, and eating all the time.” 

Incidences of obesity and Type 2 diabetes reached epidemic levels, and the most common treatments long have been drug interventions. Unfortunately, the prevailing non-pharmaceutical prescription — to eat less and move more — has a 99.9% failure rate. Fung observes that popular wisdom tells us to blame the patient and assume he or she did not adhere to the prescription. He claims a basic understanding of metabolism suggests otherwise, however.

Fung explains why a significant reduction in caloric intake leads to a decrease in basal metabolism. This biological inevitability is ignored by the proponents of the “calories in, calories out” fallacy, he observes.

He also explains why intermittent fasting is an effective alternative to traditional treatments for obesity and diabetes. The modern eating pattern keeps our insulin levels high all the time as we eat over long durations, and when insulin remains high all the time, Fung explains, our bodies store food energy as fat, and we remain hungry. 

Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, allows insulin levels to drop, which puts us in burning mode rather than storing mode.
Fung claims his recommendations are so effective that patients no longer need to say, “Oh wow, I have to go see my doctor to see what pill I need,” or, “I need to go see my doctor to see if he needs to stick a stent in me.” Instead, Fung explains, “We’re giving you the power to take back your own health, because you’re not gonna get it from anywhere else.”

Kang Jung-cheng
Taiwan Adventist Hospital
We know that with obesity, the first thing that causes it is eating more while exercising less. The current environment and the ease of living also play a role. Previously, people probably needed to walk long distances to go to class. Now there are the MRT and buses, so the first thing is that people’s physical activities have been reduced. Secondly, the consumption of sugary drinks is excessive. 

The doctor stressed that in addition to genetic factors, the causes of obesity are mainly related to diet, the amount of exercise a person gets, and overall lifestyle. Aside from having a balanced diet, more exercise is needed to combat obesity so as to avoid reduced immunity, which may lead to disease.","Almost one in two Taiwanese are overweight or obese: Health Promotion Administration"

The obesity problem is getting serious in Mexico where one in three people are overweight. The national diet, based around high-calorie and high-sugar foods, has been behind the expansion of Mexicans' waistlines. But the government is taking action with the hope of changing people's eating habits.

Now playing","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YANue4ttcIo","In this week's video, I share more of the truly amazing health benefits of eating a healthy plant based diet (and not having to do it perfectly, we don't!). I review a ton of information from my favorite plant based doctor, Dr. McDougall, who I trained with.  All of the hot topics, common health problems, and success stories are based on a solid scientific background with double blind studies published in reputable health and medical journals.  There is plenty of science to back up this way of eating, which I love given my own scientific background.

I share my own family history of a wide variety of lifestyle diseases and how I fully believe healthy plant based eating (never perfect!) has helped me prevent having to deal with any of the health issues seen in my family.  I am 48 years old, healthy BMI, and on zero medications.  I give almost all of the credit to my healthy plant based diet.

A healthy plant based diet can help prevent & reverse all of these conditions and more:
- Obesity
- Heart Disease
- Arthritis
- Bowel Problems
- Common Cancers
- Depression
- Acne
- Allergies
- Fatigue
- Headaches
- MS
- Osteoporosis
- And many more

The collective future of social design.

Speaker: Nick Stanhope (Shift Design, UK)

Design plays a powerful role in helping tackle social problems. However, when design teams work independently and competitively on specific solutions, it has limited potential to understand and contribute to the big challenges we face like climate change, wealth inequality and racial injustice. As a collective pursuit, design has extraordinary potential, but the principles and values we have inherited from commercial practice needs reimagining.

Nick will share his experience of leading dozens of social design projects around the world, what he has learnt about their limitations and how his team and other collective design practitioners are experimenting with radically different approaches.


Innovation in times of crisis.

Speaker: Cristian Fracassi (Isinnova, Italy)

Innovation is difficult and takes years? In this talk Cristian will show you the contrary. Last March, his team designed and 3D-printed 100 life-saving respirator valves in 24 hours for a hospital that had run out of them. The valve connects patients in intensive care to breathing machines, and its design has been offered for free and in an open-source way to everyone who’d like to help spreading 3D printing technology and its advantages all over the world. Cristian will highlight three projects he and his team successfully executed during the current pandemic.

What does it take to innovate in a moment of crisis? How to prototype rapidly and scale fast? What is the value of teaming up with partners, such as Decathlon, and letting health professionals and engineers work together? What can we learn from that as designers? Get inspired by the engineers’ journey how to use 3D printing hack to turn scuba masks into ventilators that started with the intuition of a retired doctor. And join the conversation by asking all the questions you would like to ask about applying agile methodologies to social innovation.

 

TALKS 2
 

Designing for good by actively empowering everyone

Speaker: Carl-Emil Jensen (Too Good to Go, Denmark)

How does the food waste value chain look like, and what challenges are we facing? Carl-Emil will share Too Good To Go’s background; why and how it started; its original goal and business model; and why it changed direction. He will give you a picture on how to turn an idea into reality by sharing Too Good To Go’s story from the very first start until now. He will explain why it is important to make mistakes and learn from it. And how to build and scale a design team, and use the value of both technology and design.

Too Good To Go is not just a hybrid, community-based service, but part of a movement. Is this the way to positively contribute to the SDGs? The SDGs are aimed to tackle wicked, systemic problems. It is difficult to play a role and have positive impact.

Carl-Emil will explain you how to grow a successful community-based service with focus on food, people and planet.


Becoming relentless change agents

Speaker: Dra. Lesley-Ann Noel (Tulane University, USA)

Social entrepreneurship and social innovation both seek to improve the world through social change. Social entrepreneurship revolves around the business side of change; social innovation focuses on the processes through which that change is generated. Contributing to the SDGs isn’t only an appeal to governments and NGOs. Small and large businesses also have their role. Wherever you work as a designer, you need to take your responsibility. Now is the time to act.

In this talk Dr. Lesley-Ann Noel will share how she uses the Sustainable Development goals to ground social innovation and in addressing local issues in New Orleans. She will also share insights on how designers can use speculation about the future in social innovation, such as the Critical Utopian Action Research framework to create a path for social innovation that create new products, services or methods that address social or environmental needs. Dr. Noel will highlight the role of collaborative design methods to create change that is focused on equity, justice and the benefit of organizations and the communities they serve.","Summit Talks"

For a world crippled by the #coronavirus, salvation hinges on a vaccine.

But in the United States, where at least 4.6 million people have been infected and nearly 155,000 have died, the promise of that vaccine is hampered by a vexing epidemic that long preceded Covid-19: obesity.
Scientists know that vaccines engineered to protect the public from #influenza, #hepatitis B, #tetanus and #rabies can be less effective in obese adults than in the general population, leaving them more vulnerable to infection and illness. There is little reason to believe, obesity researchers say, that Covid-19 vaccines will be any different.
""Will we have a COVID vaccine next year tailored to the obese? No way,"" said #RazShaikh, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina-
Will it still work in the obese? Our prediction is no.""
More than 107 million American adults are obese, and their ability to return safely to work, care for their families, and resume daily life could be curtailed if the coronavirus vaccine delivers weak immunity for them.
In March, still early in the global pandemic, a little-noticed study from China found that heavier Chinese patients afflicted with Covid-19 were more likely to die than leaner ones, suggesting a perilous future awaited the US, whose population is among the heaviest in the world.
And then that future arrived.
As intensive care units in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere filled with patients, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that obese people with a body mass index of 40 or more — known as morbid obesity or about 100 pounds overweight — were among the groups at highest risk of becoming severely ill with Covid-19. About 9% of American adults are in that category.
As weeks passed and a clearer picture of who was being hospitalized came into focus, federal health officials expanded their warning to include people with a body mass index of 30 or more. That vastly expanded the ranks of those considered vulnerable to the most severe cases of infection, to 42.4% of American adults.

An international group of scientists studying diabetes says the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how much more vulnerable people with the disease are.
Their report released to coincide with World Diabetes Day (14 November 2020) says people with diabetes are two times more likely to experience severe symptoms, or death from SARS- CoV-2.

STORY-LINE:
Diets around the world may vary, but in a growing number of countries obesity, poor nutrition and a change in lifestyle are leading to soaring numbers of people with diabetes.
The overwhelming majority, according to a new study are Type 2, which results from the body's ineffective use of insulin. 
The World Health Organization says this type of diabetes is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.
The study in the Lancet medical journal says countries with the greatest burden are China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, and Thailand.
They account for 217 million cases of type 2 diabetes, that's half of the world's diabetes cases. 
The aim of the study in the Lancet medical is to suggest a blueprint for the care of people with diabetes.
It calls for proactive measures to seek out people with the disease and screen them on a regular basis. 
It also recommends education and dietary information.
According to the study 463 million people have diabetes, eighty percent of them are from low and middle income countries.
It says last year 4.2 million people died as a result of the condition and complications that arise from it.
These can be anything from blindness, kidney failure, stroke and heart attacks, it can also necessitate limb amputation.
Now scientists say there is a clear link between the disease and COVID-19.
Lead author of the study Professor Juliana Chan is the Director of the Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
She says the increased risks of COVID-19 for diabetics are clear.
""If we use the UK as an example because they've got national data, five percent of people have diabetes, but among those who die with COVID, one third have diabetes and the death rate, the complications rates are closely related to the control of the conditions,"" according to Chan.
Chan's co-author is Professor Rury Holman from the University of Oxford.
He says:  ""The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes is bidirectional early reports from China, particularly from Wuhan, informed us that people with diabetes got the disease more often and the outcomes were worse and that's been replicated across the world in other such studies. We've also seen that people are precipitating diabetes, type one diabetes has become more common because the disease precipitates it and people with diabetes get worse metabolic control. One of the key findings has been that amongst the other risk factors for COVID hypoglycaemia, that's high blood glucose levels also make the outcomes worse and conversely, hopefully, if we were to improve glucose levels, we could reduce the risk for people with COVID-19 and diabetes.""
Holman says research into how COVID-19 works is revealing how diabetes patients may be at greater risk.
Chan and Holman are among the 44 diabetes specialists who've created a blueprint for diabetes care.
According to the study as nations move out of poverty, people's eating habits and lifestyle may change thereby increasing their risk of diabetes.
Chan says the current situation is not sustainable.

Additionally, there was an opportunity to listen to  Kasiet Ysmanova's presentation about the Central Asian Barometer research findings related to topic.



This year with the overwhelming impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the region and the world it was decided to trace how the consequences of it are changing the socio-political, economic and human dimensions of Central Asia. The pandemic hit the region devastatingly. Nearly all sectors of the economy have been affected causing major disruptions in social protection and healthcare systems, markets and employment. Information coverage of COVID-19 consequences on Central Asian societies lacked fairness and transparency. Central Asian leadership experienced growing crisis governance. State response on some key operational and institutional levels have failed to effectively and timely curb the consequences of the pandemic, which, in turn, exacerbated social and economic inequalities in the countries. This led to numerous challenges on the good governance front. The crises scaled up massive human rights abuses across the region. However, some of the region’s civil societies have shown better responsiveness and reacted swiftly seizing the momentum and becoming take-charge actors.

In light of these changes, a critical view of the scholarly and practitioners’ community into these processes is crucial.","'The COVID-19 Crisis and its Impact on Post-Soviet Central Asia' Day 3: COVID and Foreign Policy"

There are a number of studies that have come out about COVID 19 prognosis. We now have a powerful way to predict which patients with COVID 19 pneumonia are more likely to die, and more likely to require longer stays in the hospital. 

We already know that less than 15% of people who get COVID 19 have severe disease to the point of requiring hospitalization. Less than 5% of people who get coronavirus require ICU. For those with COVID 19 pneumonia who require ICU, and for some of the other patients in the hospital who might not necessarily need ICU, these are the patients who have the cytokine storm that we keep hearing about, meaning the immune system is going haywire, and there is a ton of inflammation taking place in the body….especially the lungs. But now, we have a more specific way of predicting who is more likely to develop cytokine storm, and therefore more likely to die, and who is more likely to require a longer stay in the hospital….and it's based on the bloodwork we get when patients are hospitalized.

When we get bloodwork, we’re doing various lab tests. Most commonly a complete blood count, or CBC, and a complete metabolic panel, or CMP. We often check other things as well, like troponin, d-dimer, LDH, ferritin, and CRP.  A complete blood count is specifically looking at 3 things: levels of hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cells. We can see not only the total number of WBC, but also the breakdown of the percentages of the types of white blood cells, meaning, what percentage are neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.  Lymphocytes generally make up about 15-45% of WBC. This is very important as it pertains to COVID-19, and you’ll see why in a little bit. 

The CMP stands for the complete metabolic panel, and that is looking at levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, bilirubin, albumin, and liver enzymes like AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase. Some of these also have important implications when it comes to COVID 19 disease severity. Because In the recent study done at Temple University, they analyzed over 500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, all of which had inflammation in their lungs seen on CT scan of the chest (show). They determined the criteria for COVID 19 cytokine storm. For patients who met these criteria, their length of stay in the hospital was on average 15 days, compared to 6 days if they did not meet the criteria. 

Mortality was 28.8% in the group that met criteria, vs 6.6% in those who did not meet criteria. So if they met cytokine storm criteria, their likelihood of dying was 4 times higher. And how accurate was this prediction model? Pretty accurate, as this study had a specificity of 79% and a sensitivity of 85%, which is a lot of predictive power. Most of the patients who met the criteria for CS did so at the time of admission or shortly after. This suggests that there is an early and rapid progression in these patients, and also suggests that there is a low likelihood of developing cytokine storm after 10 days of hospitalization. 

So based on these specific lab parameters, this is how doctors can predict which patients are more likely to die of COVID-19. And I do find that this study correlates with what I’ve seen in my personal experience with hospitalized covid patients. And yes, the man whose CT scan I showed you earlier in this video, met all of these criteria for cytokine storm, and he did so as soon as 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital.","How Doctors Can Predict Who Dies From COVID"

Valued at 915 million dollars, the deal involves a novel biologic dual receptor agonist, dubbed HM12525A. The new drug is now about to enter Phase 2 development for the treatment of diabetes and obesity.

Under the terms of the deal which covers regions outside Korea and China, Hanmi will receive an upfront payment of 105 million dollars and up to 810 million dollars in milestone payments. The Korean drugmaker will also bag double-digit royalties on commercial sales.

The fresh deal has been announced less than a week after Hanmi reached a landmark license deal with Sanofi of France, estimated at 3.9 billion euros, involving long-acting diabetes treatments.

 The data chart shows the share of deaths attributed to obesity across countries.

Across many middle-income countries – particularly across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, North Africa, and Latin America – more than 15% of deaths were attributed to obesity in 2018. This most likely results from having a high prevalence of obesity, but poorer overall health and healthcare systems relatively to high-income countries with similarly high levels of obesity.

In most high-income countries this share is in the range of 8 to 10%. This is about half the share of many middle-income countries. The large outliers among rich countries are Japan and South Korea: there only around 5% of premature deaths are attributed to obesity.

Are food documentaries to blame for the obesity crisis in America?  Not technically however, is it fair to say that they do feed the frenzy and FAD-TRENDING arena of all things DIET?  Maybe ...

There is NO shortage of diets out there and to be honest whatever you are eating right now is your diet; even if it lacks a specific name.  

Food documentaries certainly have their place as far as providing information and keeping us up to date with current and trending issues.  But is it always accurate and presented WITHOUT BIAS?

In this video Coach Tonya shares with you what she likes and does not like about food documentaries, as well as some tips on how to make sense of research studies to find out answers for yourself 😊
