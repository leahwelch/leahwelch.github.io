                <h1>A Brief History of my Adult Life</h1>
                <h2>(as told by my closet)</h2>
                <p>I’ve been wondering for awhile what proportion of clothing that I still own and wear was purchased during each era of my life. Every time I move, which has been often, I purge my closet and my style tends to shift according to my environment, job, and body shape.</p> 
                <p>To make more informed purchases and winnow my closet down from its current 105 pieces, I itemized every piece of clothing that I considered part of my personal style. This excluded PJs, work-out clothes, camping stuff, socks, and intimates.</p>
                <p>I tracked data ranging from type of clothing and color to where I was living when I purchased it and personal associations with the piece. I also drew every item in my closet, which turned into a meditative evening exercise with old episodes of <i>Girls</i> playing in the background.</p>
                <p>The resulting visualization contains piles of garments that light up based on the era of my life during which they entered my closet. Hover over each rectangle to learn more about it.</p>

                    <p class="narrative">However, since I became pregnant in 2018, I have done a lot less thrifting.</p>
