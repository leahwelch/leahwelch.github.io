                <h1>A Brief History of My Adult Life</h1>
                <h2>(as told by my closet)</h2>
                <p>I’ve been wondering for awhile what proportion of clothing that I still own and wear was purchased during each era of my life. Every time I move, which has been often, I purge my closet and my style tends to shift according to my environment, job, and body shape.</p> 
                <p>To make more informed purchases and winnow my closet down from its current 105 pieces, I itemized every piece of clothing that I considered part of my personal style. This excluded PJs, work-out clothes, camping stuff, socks, and intimates.</p>
                <p>I tracked data ranging from type of clothing and color to where I was living when I purchased it and personal associations with the piece. I also drew every item in my closet, which turned into a meditative evening exercise with old episodes of <i>Girls</i> playing in the background.</p>
                <p>The resulting visualization contains piles of garments that light up based on the era of my life during which they entered my closet. Hover over each rectangle to learn more about it.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Vintage shopping used to be one of my favorite social activities. I even planned my honeymoon around finding vintage treasures in Japan (there are many).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="totalVintage"></span> of my wardrobe is vintage or thrifted, and I've found it's hard to get rid of vintage items because they feel so special.</p>
				</div>
				<div id = "part_2" data-step='2'>
					<p>Since moving to the Boston area in the summer of 2019, I have done a lot less thrifting.</p>
				</div>
				<div id = "part_3" data-step='3'>
                    <p>Instead, almost all of my purchases have been online, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic started. In fact, of the items in my closet that I bought online, I purchased X% of them since relocating to the Boston area.</p>
                    <p>Most of my vintage purchases were impulse buys, a type of shopping I am happy to have stopped, at least for now.</p>
                    <p>If I bookmark something that I like and only complete a purchase after sitting with it for weeks or even months, I am more mindful of how much I am spending and whether something would actually fit into my current life.</p>

                    <p class="annotation_header">Towards a Capsule Closet</p>
                    <p>Since October 5, 2020, I have kept a log of everything I have worn. When I first created this project on November 11, 2020, I had worn only <span class="totalWorn"></span> of my total <span class="totalItems"></span> items. That's a wardrobe efficiency of <span class="efficiencyP"></span>.</p>
                    <p>Even taking into account seasonal items, I owned at least twice as much clothing as I would reasonably wear in the next year.</p>
                </div>
                <div id = "part_5" data-step='5'>
                    <p>This entire exercise was my way of determining how far I was from the capsule closet of my dreams, and if that was still something I really wanted.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to love and wear everything I own. There’s nothing like seeing stacks of unworn items to inspire a closet purge. I’m still fighting against nostalgia with much of these pieces, but after seeing my little stacks of worn and unworn items visualized as data, I have removed 9 items from my closet and brought my efficiency up to X%.</p>
