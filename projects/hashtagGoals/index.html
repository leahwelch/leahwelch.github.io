		<h2>Fashion & Sustainable Development</h2>
		<p>I reverse-engineered Giorgia Lupi’s 2017 MoMA installation <i>Capstones</i> to examine the impact of the fashion industry on sustainability.</p>
		<!-- <img src="image/capstones1.jpg" alt="Capstones by Giorgia Lupi"> -->
		<img id="intropic" src="image/capstones2.jpg" alt="Capstones by Giorgia Lupi">
		<p>Using data from Glasgow Calendonian New York College's Fair Fashion Center and their Quantum Redesign of Fashion, <i>Capstones</i> charts the progress of 8 fashion items toward meeting the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals across 15 Areas of Impact that form the commercial life cycle of a product.</p>
		
		<p>Evaluating <i>Capstones</i> as a high-level snapshot of common practices by large apparel and footwear companies, I extracted the relationships between Areas of Impact (industries) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for each item.</p>

					<p class='trigger' data-step='0'>Here’s how the data looks for a white t-shirt. <br><br>Each point indicates a stage of the product development cycle for which the Quantum Redesign model identified the potential for clear sustainability efforts, mapped to the Sustainable Development Goals that they impact.</p>

						<p>I then synthesized the data for all 8 items, highlighting the points in the commercial life cycle that are most targeted by sustainability efforts.</p>
						<!-- <br> -->
						<p>Circle size corresponds to the number of key fashion items that share the same intersection of industry and sustainability.</p>
						<div id="legendContainer"></div>
					</div>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='2'>Larger circles indicate that more fashion brands are focused at those intersections.<br><br>If all key fashion items were made with a more sustainable approach at every stage of production, they could become a catalyst for a transformation of the entire industry.</p>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='3'>By reorganizing the SDGs within the framework of <span style="color:#46A76E"><b>Planet</b></span>, <span style="color:#ED7F2E"><b>People</b></span>, and <span style="color:#947CC0"><b>Prosperity</b></span>, we can visualize where sustainability campaigns in the fashion industry place their focus.</p>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='4'>From here, we can investigate which stages of product development have the most active sustainability efforts, sorting from those with the highest impact: <br><br><span style="color:#443730">1. Manufacturing</span><br><span style="color:#443730">2. Social & Labor</span><br><span style="color:#443730">3. Waste & Circular Living</span></p>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='5'>...to the industries with the lowest sustainablity impact: <br><br><span style="color:#443730">13. Transportation & Logistics</span><br><span style="color:#443730">14. Retail & eCommerce</span><br><span style="color:#443730">15. Marketing</span></p>
					<p class='trigger' data-step='6'><span style="color:#443730">Consumer Engagement</span> and <span style="color:#443730">Transparency & Government</span> are also comparatively low-impact for sustainability, ranking at 11 and 12 respectively.</p>

		<p>Retail spaces, marketing campaigns, influencers, and consumers are an under-utilized resource in current sustainability efforts.</p>
		<p id="consumerEmphasis">Especially consumers.</p>
		<p>We don’t have enough information yet to effect change through our purchasing power.</p> 
		<p>Consumers need a standardized metric by which to evaluate the ethics and sustainable practices of the companies responsible for clothing us.</p>
		<p>If we all start asking questions of our retailers about how their products are designed, sourced, manufactured, and transported, we can exert pressure on the industry to embrace a more transparent model.</p>
