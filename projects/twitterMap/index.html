            <p id="byline">by Linh Huynh & Leah Welch</p>
            <p>George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died on May 25, 2020 after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground under the knee of a police officer, for more than nine minutes.</p>
            <p>On March 16, 2021, a series of mass shootings occurred at three spas or massage parlors in the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian women, and one other person was wounded.</p>
            <p>The Twitter community has responded to both of these tragedies through an outpouring of activism. Below is a map of tweets containing the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #StopAsianHate created between March 18 and March 21, 2021.</p> 
            <p>Circle size corresponds to the quantity of tweets in a certain location.</p>
